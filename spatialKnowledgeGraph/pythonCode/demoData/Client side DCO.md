- # Client Pull Model for Embedded Product Promotion
- [An Interview With Jack Dorsey (piratewires.com)](https://www.piratewires.com/p/interview-with-jack-dorsey-mike-solana)
- ## User-Side Components
	- ### Local Knowledge Base
		- Each user device maintains a secure, [[Hardware and Edge]] local knowledge base.
		- This base contains user preferences, interests, and demographic data, organised as a lookup table. Hashes represent product classes or categories of product that are interesting to the user (opt in)
	- ### Nostr Integration
		- User's device includes a [[nostr]] client to interact with the decentralised Nostr network.
		- The Nostr client accesses the local knowledge base to retrieve relevant product class hashes.
		- These hashes are used to pull personalised marketing content from the Nostr network.
	- ### Embedding in User-Side Applications
		- Personalised marketing content is seamlessly embedded into the user's preferred applications, such as Roblox, [[NVIDIA Omniverse]] , and web browsers.
		  This ensures relevant and engaging marketing content within the context of the user's usual digital experiences.
	- ### Marketer-Side Components
		- [[Multimodal]] Product Representation
		- Marketers create rich, multi-modal representations of their products, capturing visual appearance, textual descriptions, and other relevant attributes.
		  These are [[Training and fine tuning]] using AI to generate variations catering to different user preferences and demographics.
	- ### Cloud-Based Latent Space
		- Fine-tuned product variations are stored in a cloud-based [[latent space]] , a high-dimensional vector space where each point represents a specific product variation.
		- This [[latent space]] is organised and indexed for efficient retrieval based on user preferences.
	- ### Nostr Network Distribution and Support
		- Marketers distribute product variations across a cloud of [[Nostr]] servers, each variation associated with a unique Nostr event containing metadata and content.
		- The Nostr servers act as a decentralised storage and distribution network for marketing content.
		- Advertisers and brand leaders support the Nostr network by subsidising network nodes, helping maintain network infrastructure and incentivising node operators.
	- ### Interaction Flow
		- The user's device, with a Nostr client, accesses the local knowledge base to retrieve relevant product class hashes.
		- These hashes are used to pull personalised marketing content from the Nostr network, which matches hashes with corresponding product variations in the cloud-based latent space.
		- The matched product variations are then returned to the user's device via the Nostr network, ensuring the marketer has no direct access to the user's personal information or identity.
	- ### Benefits and Considerations
		- #### User Privacy
		- The user's knowledge base is kept local to their device, using hashes to retrieve personalised content, which enhances [[Politics, Law, Privacy]] by avoiding centralized data collection and tracking.
		- [[Hyper personalisation]] and Dynamic Creative Optimisation (DCO)
		- The system delivers content optimised for the user's language, environment, age, and other demographic factors using AI-powered multi-modal product representations.
		- DCO techniques dynamically adapt and optimise creative elements in real-time based on user interactions and preferences.
		- #### Scalability and Efficiency
		- The [[Decentralised Web]] Nostr architecture allows for efficient distribution and retrieval of marketing content.
		- Advertiser subsidies help maintain a robust and reliable network infrastructure.
		- ### Integration and User Experience
		- Personalised marketing content is embedded into the user's preferred applications for a seamless experience.
		   Ethical Considerations
		- It's crucial to ensure user awareness and consent for using the local knowledge base for personalised marketing.
		- Implement clear communication and opt-in mechanisms for transparency and user control.
		- #### Measurement and Analytics
		- The exploration of privacy-preserving measurement techniques allows for aggregate insights without compromising individual user privacy.
		- #### Ecosystem Sustainability
		- Advertiser subsidies contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Nostr network, fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem.
		- #### Future Vision
		- The system aims to expand advertiser participation and subsidies to strengthen the Nostr network infrastructure further.
		- Collaboration with the Nostr community and stakeholders will refine the system's design and drive adoption.
		- Advanced AI and ML techniques will enhance [[Hyper personalisation]] and DCO capabilities, fostering a thriving ecosystem benefiting from a privacy-focused approach. -
