- Microsoft are bringing parametric (volume) design to Meta Quest.
- # Overview
	- Voice and text to parametric CAD primitives and larger digital twin models, in shared virtual spaces is an important and necessary feature for commercial metaverse. We can already see examples and hints of this in current virtual reality and augmented reality applications.
	- These technologies enable users to manipulate and interact with 3D objects in real-time, bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. As the metaverse continues to evolve, the integration of voice and text input will undoubtedly play a crucial role in enhancing the overall user experience.
	- Imagine being able to verbally command a virtual design software to create specific CAD primitives or modify existing models. Additionally, the ability to add text annotations or descriptions directly within the virtual space can facilitate collaboration and communication among users.
	- Furthermore, as corporate metaverse like [[NVIDIA Omniverse]] expands, the shared virtual spaces will become increasingly complex and vast, accommodating a multitude of digital twin models. This means that users will be able to explore and interact with realistic replicas of real-world objects and environments, such as buildings, vehicles, or even entire cities.
	- By incorporating voice and text input functionalities, developers can empower users to manipulate and navigate these digital twin models more intuitively. Whether it's adjusting the dimensions of a virtual prototype or performing intricate measurements, the metaverse's ability to recognize and respond to voice and text commands will revolutionize the way we design, simulate, and experience virtual environments.
