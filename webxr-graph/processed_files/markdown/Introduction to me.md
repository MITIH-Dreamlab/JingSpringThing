- Currently I am Spatial AI Lead in an emerging [media innovation lab](https://www.mediacityuk.co.uk/immersive-technologies-innovation-hub/), supporting human storytelling with immersive and AI tech.
- I am also Chief Hallucination Officer for [DreamLab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamlabinstitute/?); an emerging institute of creatives, academics, professionals, storytellers and technologists.

	- I have a micro company which develops open source software and knowledge, and offers consultancy called "[flossverse](https://github.com/flossverse)" (free, libre, open source software - verse).

	- This interface is an example of [[Knowledge Graphing and RAG]].

		- [[Logseq]] is a knowledge management and note-taking tool, integrated with AI capabilities.
		- This is updated a couple of times a week, but you WILL need to hit CTRL-R as I didn't code a refresh into it.
		- Below is the [graph](https://www.visionflow.info/680a51ea177aecc8cafb7003e146622b7ca13257/index.html#/graph) view of about 1/6 of my current research base.
		- **You can find it as "Graph" top right of this page.**
		- You should probably stop reading this page and go click graph and find something you like.

- # Strategic Alignment
	- [Gartners provides a handy and up-to-date visual for emerging tech](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/30-emerging-technologies-that-will-guide-your-business-decisions?utm_term=1724261337?). It happens to intersect with my research interests and expertise in the main, and I have highlighted the relevant elements (for me), in pink. Everything there is somewhere, or everywhere in the knowledge base.

- # My research in broad stokes:
	- ## Equity of opportunity of access to AI:
		- Genius is evenly distributed across humanity. There are as many incredible minds per capita in India, South America, Nigeria, China, South East Asia, as anywhere in the highly developed world. Access to the identity rails, money rails, education, technology, and now AI, is *not* equitably distributed. I am trying to change that a little by focusing on protocols.
	- ## Convergence :
		- Everything is smoothing out as GenAI scaffolds human work. The interfaces won't need to be learnt any more. [[Social contract and jobs]] may soon be radically different. This is a [[Convergence]] but is also a [[Disruption]].
	- ## Disruption:
		- This is happening so fast that many are viewing it as a [[Singularity]] event; that we will likely see as many problems as benefits initially. -
	- ## The potential opportunity offered by [[Bitcoin]]:
		- I have been studying Bitcoin technologies for the past 7 years. This novel ecosystem is a non-trivial disruptive force, and is now deeply threaded through my technical research.
	- ## My research as a diagram

	- ## Note about links
		- In *my* version of the knowledge graph all the twitter links render interactively, inline, you will just see "loading" on the web. There are a lot of them, like this one. Sometimes you might just seen a loading with no link, that means I forgot that one, it's not going to load.
		- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1758235873433243950)

- # The Graph
	- This is the raw "shoot from the hip" LogSeq graph. There is a manually version where we inject the key topics back in to create edges, and there's a [[Knowledge Graphing and RAG]] using [[Microsoft]] [[GraphRAG]]
	- They power [some stuff](https://github.com/jjohare/logseqSpringThing/tree/feature-branch) that is more [[Immersive]] which will be ready soon, probably.
