- ## Palantir emerging as global leader in mil AI.
	- Early on June 1, 2022, Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp and colleagues entered Ukraine, offering their AI and data analytics support for the country's defense against the Russian invasion.
	- This move marked a pioneering collaboration between a Western tech firm and Ukraine, aiming to leverage cutting-edge technology in warfare.
	- Palantir integrated its data analytics and AI software across multiple Ukrainian government sectors, significantly impacting military strategies and civilian projects.
	- The software's capabilities range from analyzing satellite imagery and drone footage for military targeting to supporting evidence collection for war crimes and facilitating refugee resettlement.

		- **Key Bullet Points:**
			- Autonomous weapons are inevitable; the debate centers on who will build them and for what purpose.
			- Historically, the threat of catastrophic weapons (e.g., nuclear bombs) has maintained global peace, preventing major world wars.
			- U.S. military supremacy has played a significant role in deterring conflicts.
			- The future of warfare lies in AI-driven technologies, surpassing conventional weapons.
			- Development of AI in military contexts faces resistance from Silicon Valley engineers and companies.
			- Examples include Google abandoning Project Maven and Microsoft employees opposing an augmented-reality project for the U.S. Army.
			- Despite resistance, companies like Palantir are committed to developing AI for defense.
			- There is a cultural and ethical shift in the tech industry towards consumer-focused innovations rather than addressing societal challenges.
			- Failure to invest in military technology could give adversaries an advantage in developing autonomous weapons.
			- Authors argue that the ethical debate should not prevent providing necessary technological support to military forces.

- ## Broader Tech Industry Support
	- Besides Palantir, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Clearview AI contributed technology and services to Ukraine, enhancing cybersecurity, data management, and identification processes.
	- This collective effort underscores a broader trend of tech companies engaging directly in conflict zones, transforming Ukraine into a global tech R&D lab.
	- The collaboration is accelerating the integration of AI and autonomous systems in military operations, potentially redefining future warfare.
	- Ukraine's situation offers a unique testbed for new technologies, with real-time feedback loops for rapid innovation and deployment.
- ## Ethical and Strategic Considerations
	- The involvement of private tech companies in warfare raises questions about legal, ethical, and privacy concerns, alongside the potential for technology proliferation to adversaries.
	- Palantir and other firms' contributions also spotlight the evolving role of the tech sector in national security, with companies acting as de facto defense partners.
	- More positively it can contribution to battle damage assessment in Ukraine using machine learning algorithms to analyse imagery and detect changes.

- # What we can expect
	- The potential of AI to dominate warfare in the next decade, exacerbating issues of disinformation and misinformation.
	- The accessibility of AI tools for creating realistic content, enhancing the capabilities of bad actors in misinformation campaigns.
	- The critical need for investment in data infrastructure and preparation to counter the threats posed by AI in warfare.
	- The concept of deterrence in military thinking and how it might evolve with the advent of AI technologies.
	- The importance of data as a new form of ammunition in AI-driven warfare.
	- The mission of the speaker and like-minded technologists to leverage AI for improving national security and maintaining global stability.
	- The urgent call for more technologists to understand the critical nature of the current era and commit to supporting national security efforts.
	- Swarms of lethal drones equipped with facial recognition technology.
	- Unmanned armed robots that are nearly impossible to defeat.
		- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX0ji1sAXl8}}
	- Autonomous fighter jets capable of supersonic speeds and enduring greater gravitational forces than human pilots.
	- Cyberattacks aimed at disabling critical port infrastructure.
	- Disinformation campaigns and deepfakes that can manipulate presidential elections.
	- Foreign adversaries capable of disabling satellites, impairing global surveillance and communication.
- # China vs The West
	- China ahead in computer vision AI and rapidly catching up in large language models.
	- China's military spending, especially in AI, dwarfing that of the United States.
	- The critical role of data in AI warfare, with the current underutilization of data from U.S. military assets being a significant disadvantage.
	- The reluctance of the U.S. tech industry to engage in government contracts, hindering AI advancements in defence.
	- China demands signoff and approval on all new [[Large language models]]
	- USA invokes defence production act to force cloud providers to monitor training, and asserts all USA training should notify the pentagon.

	  "A new Chinese study claims that machine gun-armed robot dogs are as accurate as trained human marksmen. 
	  If true, we could be about to witness a revolution of sorts in urban warfare."
	  The study’s findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal The Chinese Journal of Engineering last month.
	  According to the research team, they have developed a special weapon mount specifically designed for the task. 
	  This contrasts with American attempts that, in effect, just strap a weapon to the back of the robot dog.
	  “The urban landscape, with its maze of intersecting streets and towering edifices packed tightly together, 
	  poses unique challenges for unmanned combat platforms. These platforms must negotiate unstructured terrain 
	  and execute intricate actions such as maneuvering, scaling, and leaping – rendering traditional wheeled and 
	  tracked designs inadequate,” added the team."
