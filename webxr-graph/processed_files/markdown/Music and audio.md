	- [meta musicgen](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-melody/)Ryan Hoover, founder of Product Hunt, tweeted an idea for an “AI Spotify” that could host AI-generated music by submitting music with the best tracks based on listens and likes earning a pro-rata share of subscription revenue, reserved for original artists. The tweet sparked interest, leading to someone building the platform called Beatly Music, while some artists expressed interest in the idea. However, industry insiders, including Scott Belsky, have questioned why Spotify might not just do this themselves since they already have the fan graph, the data set, and relationship with artists. But it may be too risky to navigate for a large company with record labels as a key stakeholder. While the idea has potential, there are many ethical and legal issues with this model, especially with labels. Nevertheless, Beatly Music carries a considerable risk as several legal concerns may arise regarding music rights and royalties, stating that some significant damages, including [[copyright]] infringement charges or compounding royalties to record labels and artists, might come up. https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1647735300511154176
