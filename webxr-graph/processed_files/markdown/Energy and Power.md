	- Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency:
		- Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are energy-intensive
		- Compete with other growing sources of electricity demand, but allows complex 'buyer of last resort' dynamics
		- May face regulatory pressure due to environmental concerns and grid constraints
	- ## Mining process overview
	- Bitcoin mining is the process of adding public transactions into the ledger, in return for two economic rewards, paid in Bitcoin. These are the mining fee, and the block reward. The transactions which are added into the next 'block' of the chain are selected preferentially based on the fee they offer, which is up to the user trying to get their transaction into the chain. This can be within the next 10 minutes (next block), or a gamble out toward 'never' depending how competitive the network is at any time. Miners try to find a sufficiently low result from a cryptographic hash function \[[53]\](../assets/a random process), and upon finding it, they can take their pre-prepared 'block' of transactions sourced from their local queue (mempool), and add it into the chain, for confirmation by other miners. In return they take all the fees within that mined block, and whatever the block reward is at the time. When the network started the block reward was 50 Bitcoin, but has [halved](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/) repeatedly every 210,000 blocks (four years) and now stands at 6.25 BTC. The rate of mining is kept roughly at one block every 10 minutes, by a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks (2 weeks). This in a complex interdependent mechanism and is explained very well in [this article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network). These components are explained in slightly more detail later.
	- ## Energy & policy response

	- At the end of 2022 it is thought to be the case that the only profitable miners are the large scale companies who are also providing load balancing services to energy companies. This is unusual in the history of mining, and the situation will likely change over time. This is not to say that all mining is, or should be, so concentrated. Anyone running the hashing algorithm can [get lucky](https://twitter.com/ckpooldev/status/1485585814419812356) and claim the block reward. PoW ties the value of the 'money' component of Bitcoin directly to energy production. This is not a new idea. Henry Ford proposed an intimate tie between energy and money to create a separation of powers from government, as can be seen in Figure [3.18](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F18 "Figure 3.18 ‣ Energy & policy response ‣ 3.4.2 Mining and Energy concerns ‣ 3.4 Bitcoin ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art").

	- The potential ecological footprint of the network has always been a concern; Hal Finney was [thinking about this issue](https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1153096538) with a mature Bitcoin network as early as August 2009, and [a debate](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/threads/167/#35) on the Bitcoin mailing lists called the mining process "thermodynamically perverse".
	- In a recent email release during a court case a new Satoshi Nakamoto email from May 2009 shows that this was a concern to the designer of the protocol.

	- The most cited negative analysis on the matter by Mora et al sees Bitcoin mining alone warming the planet above 2 degrees \[[54]\].
	- [Proponents of the technology](https://electricmoney.org/) say that the balance shifted dramatically in 2021 with China outright banning the technology; this has forced the bulk of the energy use [toward the USA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E7489rM7Q62oXwk1f4NUlMvok9noAbpYfTynY2VTyww/edit#gid=0), and away from 'dirty coal' as seen in Figure [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F19 "Figure 3.19 ‣ Energy & policy response ‣ 3.4.2 Mining and Energy concerns ‣ 3.4 Bitcoin ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art").

	- ["As we get more renewable generation, in particular wind \[which\] is operating at night ... we have to find a home for it, otherwise we have to turn the wind down. It's such a great resource we shouldn't turn it down. Bitcoin mining or what some call crypto has found a way to come into our markets and take some of that wind in off-peak periods. Then when we get to peak period times they are very quick to remove themselves from the market as prices increases The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers is fantastic. We can use that crypto currency to soak up that excess generation when there's a lot of that, and find a home for more solar and more wind to come to our grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So it's a great balancing act. Most other datacenters \[such as\] Microsoft or Amazon have other customers to serve every other day, so they can't just turn off. But these crypto customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high they can remove themselves from the market. They are also helpful if we lose a generator. They can quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid."\ ] Flexible load balancing is entering the [mainstream news cycle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2023/01/27/why-no-one-saw-the-success-of-demand-response-coming/?) as and is gaining traction in legislative bodies. This ["global energy market revolution"](https://www.citadel21.com/bitcoin-is-the-first-global-market-for-electricity-and-will-unleash-renewables) is explained by Tabatabai of Modo Energy. Incredibly Bitcoin mining in Texas is now making the grid both more reliable and cheaper for consumers. In the UK we have similar problems because wind power is not evenly distributed, and moving it around is complex and expensive, and the whole system needs smoothing out with [gas plants](https://archy.deberker.com/the-uk-is-wasting-a-lot-of-wind-power/).
	- There is growing interest and adoption of so called ["stranded energy mining"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/oman-backs-u-s-firm-mining-crypto-to-cut-natural-gas-flaring) which cannot be effectively transmitted to consumers, and is thereby sold at a huge discount while also [developing power capacity](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/900mw-wind-farm-to-power-bitcoin-mining-operation/), without the [usual constraints](https://batcoinz.com/the-renewable-energy-cannot-happen-without-bitcoin-mining%ef%bf%bc/) \[[60]\]. One such example is ["Gridless" in Kenya](https://gridlesscompute.com/news/), which seeks to harness abundant green energy resources in rural areas with the hope of kick-starting economic growth. This feature of the network first came to popular attention in 2020 when Stevens, CEO of Stoneridge capital included the following text in a letter to shareholders within their [annual report](https://www.stoneridgefunds.com/documents/AnnualReport.pdf?v=4):
		- "Bitcoin mining is the only profitable use of energy in human history that does not need to be located near human settlement to operate. The long-term implications of this are world changing and hiding in plain sight."

	- Cheikosman, a policy analyst for the World Economic Forum (somewhat surprisingly) [wrote](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/crypto-energy-consumption/?) ["Crypto is becoming an essential part of developing a carbon-neutral energy grid and has made it economically viable to invest in, develop and build renewable energy power generation."]  This is explored in detail by Ibanez et al \[[61]\].
	- [Morgan Stanley research suggesting that BTC miners are the fastest path to put new data centers online because they already have access to huge amounts of power.](https://twitter.com/mikealfred/status/1781333730071896152)
	  {{twitter https://twitter.com/mikealfred/status/1781333730071896152}}
	- The most cited example of building capacity before grid connection is El Salvador's 'volcano mining' proposal, which is supporting their national power infrastructure plans. Uzbekistan seems to be promoting a [similar model](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uzbekistan-legalises-solar-powered-crypto-mining-2022-05-04/) with zero tax provided the Bitcoin mining companies build out their own solar infrastructure. A more poignant example is the [Mechanicville hydro plant in the USA](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php). The refurbishment of this 123 year old power plant is being funded by Bitcoin mining. This is the ["buyer of last resort"](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/) model first [advanced by Square Inc](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/bcei-white-paper).
	- Conversely it might be that vertical integration of Bitcoin mining [within legacy fossil fuel stations](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/oil-companies-partner-with-bitcoin-miners) gives them a new lease of life. New York State has dealt with this kind of threat by imposing a moratorium on new, fossil fuel powered mining activity. On a global stage something as portable and industrial as Bitcoin mining will have unintended impacts on fragile energy systems, as has happened in [South Ossetia](https://ceobs.org/environmental-governance-in-frozen-conflicts/) and [Kazakhstan](https://restofworld.org/2022/crypto-miners-fleeing-kazakhstan/) (note [Russia has stepped into this](https://thenewscrypto.com/kazakhstans-crypto-miners-to-acquire-electricity-from-russia/) mess). Undeniably the [consensus position](https://time.com/6193004/crypto-climate-impact-facts/) is that it's overall very negative, (with some caveats) and this will [probably]  persist. Perhaps though if it's happening anyway, then finding utility of the asset might mitigate the net harm.
	- More pragmatically, Baur and Oll found that ["Bitcoin investments can be less carbon intensive than standard equity investments and thus reduce the total carbon footprint of a portfolio."[\[] [62][\]] ] . Perhaps of note for the near future is that KPMG whose investment was mentioned in the introduction also matched their position in the space with equivalent carbon offsets. This may provide an investment and growth model for others.
	- The first US-based [nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230305005096/en/TeraWulf-Announces-Energization-and-Rapid-Deployment-of-Mining-Operations-at-the-Nautilus-Facility-in-Pennsylvania) has just opened in Pennsylvania. The facility has been completed by Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of independent power producer Talon Energy. Talon Energy owns the adjacent 2.5 GW Nuclear Power Plant and has been dabbling in Bitcoin mining for some time, opening a zero carbon Bitcoin mining facility in collaboration with Terawolf in August 2021. The new facility will operate with a maximum capacity of 48 MW, drawing on excess power from the nuclear plant. By locating the mining facility on the combined 1200 acre campus, there is no intermediation by legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities, as the mining is directly connected to the power station. Cumulus Data is in the process of building two additional 48 MW facilities and has identified 18 additional Talon Energy sites with potential to host data centres directly connected to electricity generation infrastructure. In general, there is a shift in attitudes towards nuclear in the US. The enormous benefit to this model stems from the cots associated with scaling down atomic power output to match grid requirements. By co-locating in this way the reactor can work at highest efficiency all the time, and can earn money from the generation of Bitcoin when the grid is unable to accept the energy. It is increasingly possible to find excited talk about funding smaller more pragmatic nuclear power plants using the cost benefits of the Bitcoin mining model, though this remains untested.
	- The power commitment to the network is variously projected [to increase](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8), or [level off over time](https://assets.website-files.com/614e11526f6630959fc98679/616df63a27a7ec339f5e6a80_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf). The emission schedule of the code suggests that the energy usage will decrease exponentially over time, and indeed many analysts feel that it has peaked due to a combination of factors. It's one of the maddening unknowns of the technology how this will all pan out. The [industry now argues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2022/04/03/is-bitcoin-really-that-bad-for-the-environment/?sh=6a3203427143) that economic pressures mean that most of the 'hashrate' is [generated by renewable energy](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/q4-bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-sustainable-power-mix-and-technological-efficiency/)\[[63]\]. As a recent example of this trend Telsa (Elon Musk), Block (Twitters Jack Dorsey), and Blockstream (Adam Back) are teaming up to [mine with solar energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html) in Texas.
	- Paez and Cross [prepared a paper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/627aa615676bdd1d47ec97d4/62f41b9ce54e014f9869efa7_OSTP.docx.pdf) for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, submitted through the Bitcoin Policy Institute, which is a growing thinktank for academics and industry leaders. Their summary points echo the assertions made here, but they provide rich additional referencing for those who wish to dig deeper into this:
		- Bitcoin's value, both its economic value and promotion of American values and American national interests must frame any discussion of its environmental impact.
		- Bitcoin's value is inherently tied to its consensus mechanism:  proof of work.
		- While bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, its energy use is often overestimated and improperly characterized as a function of transaction volume.
		- Due to bitcoin's exponentially decreasing schedule of issuance, mining's actual emissions are likely to peak at under 1% of global emissions, even if prices rise more than tenfold within the decade.
		- Mining's profile as a consumer of energy is unique: extremely cost-sensitive, and invariant across times and     locations.
		- Bitcoin mining, as a buyer of first and last resort, incentivises the buildout of renewable power production. As a controllable load resource (CLR) bitcoin mining also strengthens the grid, allowing it to reliably function at a high level of renewable penetration.
		- [Mining's energy use is increasingly non-rival, trending towards a diet of renewables and stranded, wasted energy resources such as flared methane.
	- [The debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LP8G-oZnEs) whether this consumption is 'worth' it is [complex](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/bitcoin-mining-as-a-grid-resource-its-complicated/617896/) and [rapidly evolving](https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/no-hearing-on-bitcoins-energy-use-is-complete-without-nic-carter/). Useful examples of this are:
		- the [online     pushback](https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/questionable-ethics-anti-bitcoin-esg-junk-science)     to an academic article by PhD candidate de Vries et al.     \[[64]\]
		- the assertion that the widely cited Mora er al. paper in Nature     \[[54]\] was based     on an [undergraduate class     discussion](https://twitter.com/NateHawaii/status/1460706785216450560),     and has had an outsized effect on global policy.
	- It is somewhat confusing that positive views are coming only from diverse and non-specialist voices in the community, and never the academic community, but the shortcomings they point out in the supposedly considered articles such as Mora et al \[[54]\] are easily verified. Academia seems [poorly positioned](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-could-never-be-invented-in-a-university) to pivot to this subject, as an ethical bar has to be established before research can commence, and the field is too new to make this an affordable task. This stuff is existentially important to the whole technology. Is a trillion dollar asset which [potentially replaces](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-gold) the money utility of [[Gold]], but doesn't need to be stored under guard in vaults (Figure [3.21](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F21 "Figure 3.21 ‣
	- Energy & policy response ‣ 3.4.2 Mining and Energy concerns ‣ 3.4 Bitcoin ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art")), worth the equivalent power consumption of clothes dryers in North America? Probably not with the current level of adoption, but this is an experiment in replacing global money. If that were to happen then Bitcoin would be around 50 times more efficient than the current system according to Khazzaka \[[65]\]. To be clear it's not the position of this book that replacing Fiat money is a good idea, but the experiment is being run regardless. This is explored in it's own chapter later.

- # Bitcoin and AI data centres
	- Bitcoin miners like Iris Energy are uniquely positioned with access to large amounts of power and data center capacity. This is becoming increasingly scarce and valuable as demand for AI computing grows exponentially.
	- The Bitcoin mining data centers can be repurposed to provide AI cloud services by swapping out Bitcoin mining ASICs for Nvidia GPUs. This allows miners to monetize their power and infrastructure for both crypto mining and AI.
	- There are parallels between the Bitcoin ASIC and AI GPU markets - both have a dominant player (Bitmain for ASICs, Nvidia for GPUs) and prices are set based on what the market is willing to pay vs cost of production.
	- The growth in AI seems to be shifting the narrative and reducing criticism around Bitcoin mining's energy use. As people realize AI's value, they accept that the energy use is justified, similar to Bitcoin.
	- Major banks like Morgan Stanley are now writing serious research reports on how Bitcoin miners are positioned to support AI's growth by providing much-needed power capacity. This validates the industry's maturity.
	- Time to accessing power is becoming the key constraint and source of value as demand for AI computing capacity far outstrips supply. Bitcoin miners with existing power access have a major advantage.
	- By locating in areas with excess renewable energy that can't be fully exported, Bitcoin miners are actually helping make these renewable installations more economically viable and efficient.
