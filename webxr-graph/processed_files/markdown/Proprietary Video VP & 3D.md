	- ### Pika Labs
		- **Current leader**:
		  {{tweet https://twitter.com/martial_artwork/status/1742138390517014918}}
		- **Prompt Creativity & Flexibility**: Excels in this area, enabling users to directly influence the animation with their prompts.
		- **Human Motion Animation**: Attempts adventurous animations but may result in distortions.
		- **Camera Motion Options**: Offers accurate, straightforward camera motions but lacks the dynamic range of Runway ML.
		- **Pros**: Free version (recently reduced quality), supports multiple aspect ratios, provides tutorials for prompt writing.
		- **Cons**: Creations are visible to other users, potential for idea theft, and traffic issues on Discord server‚Äã[](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/revolutionary-ai-animation-tools-pika-vs-runway-78636)‚Äã‚Äã[](https://dragganaitool.uk/pika-labs-vs-runwayml-gen2/)‚Äã. Expensive to use through [Pika Art website](https://pika.art/login) $60pcm,
	- ### Runway ML
		- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/bennash/status/1746188870679400543)
		  {{twitter https://twitter.com/bennash/status/1746188870679400543}}
		- **Basic Animation**: Offers cinematic camera movements and more convincing human motion, but faces issues with brightness and image integrity.
		- **Prompt Creativity & Flexibility**: Less flexible in prompt creativity, occasionally disregarding user prompts.
		- **Human Motion Animation**: Produces high-quality animations but sometimes distorts the original image.
		- **Camera Motion Options**: Provides dynamic camera shots, including zooming, panning, and rotating, but may lead to distortion.
		- **Pros**: Web-based platform ensuring privacy, offers 120 free credits, advanced features, and the option to extend video length.
		- **Cons**: Limited to 16:9 aspect ratio, may not be as flexible as Pika Labs in prompt generation‚Äã[](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/revolutionary-ai-animation-tools-pika-vs-runway-78636)‚Äã‚Äã[](https://dragganaitool.uk/pika-labs-vs-runwayml-gen2/)‚Äã.
	- ### Mid Journey have said:
		- **Midjourney Video** "will not be like any other AI video products that are currently available out there and will be 10X better."
			- **David Holz**: ‚Äú*MidJourney video may not be consistently making what you want, but the quality will be consistently good by default.*‚Äù
		- **Video Training**: The Midjourney team will start to train the video/animation model, which will come before 3D.
			- Already have all the data needed to train the model.
		- **3D:** needs more data to train, so it‚Äôs a bit slower than expected.

			- # [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]]
			- üü¢ I could go on all day about this, goods and bads. I literally wrote a book on it.
			- üü¢ A lot (for me) hinges on [[OpenUSD]] the universal scene language. It's been SO long since we have had something useful.
			- Nvidia have a text to 3D pipeline for [[Omniverse]]. Will be interesting to see what the use cases are. This is their new Cesium [geo tile integration](https://cesium.com/blog/2024/01/16/now-available-[[NVIDIA Omniverse]]-aeco-demo-pack/) giving global instant models.
