- # What is Bitcoin, what does it do?
	- Bitcoin isn’t simply "magic internet money" anymore. It’s a swarm of open-source tools which can (in theory) accomplish a great many things.

- These newer, ancillary elements to Bitcoin are emergent right now. Some of them won’t be around until next year, and it’s questionable whether they will even work out. With that said, we aren’t convinced by the value proposition of Ethereum, and there’s enough Bitcoin tooling for us to cherry-pick useful components.
- # About Bitcoin
	- The first blockchain was the Bitcoin network, [[Nakamoto 2008]] some two decades after Haber et al. first described the idea. [[Haber 1990]] Prior to Bitcoin, these structures were called ‘timechains.’ [[Nakamoto 2018]] It can be considered a triple-entry bookkeeping system, [[Ijiri 1986; Faccia 2019]] the first of its kind, integrating a ‘provable’ timestamp with a transaction ledger, solving the “double spend problem.” [[Chohan 2021; Perez 2019; Grunspan 2018]] Some see this as the first major innovation in ledger technology since double entry was codified in Venice in fourteen seventy-five. [[Sangster 2015]]
	- It was created pseudonymously by an [individual](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6bUyu2izFznSqdb6bbGLr0) calling themselves ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ in 2009, as a direct response to the perceived mishandling of the 2008 global financial crisis, [[nakamoto2018]] with the stated aim of challenging the status quo, with an [uncensorable](https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-was-wrong-we-need-crypto-587ccb03) technology, to create money which could not be [debased by inflation policy](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source), and outside of the [politically captured](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/04/matt-taibbi-paypals-deplatforming-and-the-case-for-crypto/) fintech incumbents. It’s interesting to note that the narrative around the use case for Bitcoin has [shifted over its lifetime](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/).
	- The [“genesis block”](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) which was hard-coded at the beginning of the ‘chain’ contains text from The Times newspaper detailing the second bank bailout.
	- There will only ever be ([just short of](https://blog.amberdata.io/why-the-bitcoin-supply-will-never-reach-21-million)) 21 million bitcoins issued, of which around 19 million have already been minted, and around 4 million lost forever. This ‘hard money’ absolute scarcity is a strong component of the Bitcoin meme landscape. These are basically arbitrary figures though; a combination of the issuance schedule, and an [‘educated guess’](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html) by Nakamoto:[[nakamoto2018]]
		- *”My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it’s locked in and we’re stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”*
	- Digital scarcity is incredibly important and is explained well by software engineer Hillibrand in a podcast (this text is paraphrased): “Digital scarcity is an interesting concept that was well explained by German economist Guido Hülsmann in his book “The Ethics of Money Production,” [[hulsmann2008ethics]] published in 2007. Hülsmann stated that an economic good that is defined entirely in terms of bits and bytes is unlikely ever to be produced spontaneously on a free market, and at the time, he was right. However, the emergence of Bitcoin would soon prove that digital scarcity could indeed be achieved. Hülsmann noted that an economic good must be scarce and rivalrous, meaning there is a potential for conflict over who can utilize the resource. For example, air is abundant but still considered scarce as its availability can be limited in specific situations, leading to conflicts over its use. The concept of digital scarcity is built on the idea that information, which is fundamentally not scarce, can be made scarce through specific mechanisms. Bitcoin, for instance, addresses the double-spending problem, where a digital token could be spent more than once, by establishing a decentralized network that prevents the same coin from being used in multiple transactions. Nakamoto devised a system that allows users to establish scarcity and rivalrousness in cyberspace without relying on a single trusted third party. Instead of relying on a central authority, like a government, to determine the validity of transactions, Bitcoin relies on a network of computers known as “full nodes” that verify and enforce a set of rules. This decentralized system enables the creation of digital goods that are both scarce and rivalrous, which was previously thought to be impossible.”
	- In theory, there is no [barrier to access](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2021/09/29/against-cryptocurrency-the-ethical-argument-for-bitcoin-maximalism/?), and [equality of opportunity](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/16/why-bitcoin-is-a-tool-for-social-justice/) to accumulate and save over long periods. This is not true of chains and tokens, which lock up some of their value for seed investors to cash out later. None of the blockchains since are decentralized in the same way.[[selvam2021blockchain]] Bitcoin was probably a [singular event](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892).
	- Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis (sats), so anyone buying into Bitcoin can buy a thousandth of a pound, assuming they can find someone willing to transact that with them.
	- Satoshi Nakamoto (the name of the publishing entity) [disappeared from the forums](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-happened-when-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-disappeared) forever in 2010. Bitcoin has the marks of cypherpunks and anarcho-capitalism. The IMF has recently conceded that Bitcoin [poses a risk](https://blogs.imf.org/2022/01/11/crypto-prices-move-more-in-sync-with-stocks-posing-new-risks/) to traditional financial systems, so it could be argued that it is succeeding in this original aim.
	- Although there were some earlier experiments (hashcash, b-money etc.), Bitcoin is the first viably decentralized ‘cryptocurrency’; the network is used to [store economic value](https://www.aier.org/article/why-does-bitcoin-have-value/) because it is judged to be secure and trusted. It is a singular event in that it became established at scale, such that it could be seen to be a fully distributed system, without a controlling entity. This is the differentiated trust model previously mentioned. This relative security is the specific unique selling point of the network. It is many times more secure than all the networks which came after based on a like-for-like comparison of [transaction ‘confirmations’](https://howmanyconfs.com/). This network effect of Bitcoin is a compounding feature, attracting value through the security of the system. It is deliberately more conservative and feature-poor, preferring instead to [add to its feature set](https://bips.xyz/) slowly, preserving the integrity of the value invested in it over the last decade. At the time of writing, it is a [top quartile](https://fiatmarketcap.com/) largest global currency and has settled over $13 trillion dollars in 2021, though Makarov et al. contest this, citing network overheads and speculation.[[makarov2021blockchain]] Institution-grade ‘exchange tradable funds’ which allow investment in Bitcoin are available throughout the world, and the native asset can be bought by the public easily through apps in all but a handful of countries as seen in Figure <a href="#fig:settled2021" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:settled2021">3.5</a>.

	- Only around 7 transactions per second can be settled on Bitcoin. The native protocol does not scale well, and this is an inherent trade-off as described by Croman et al. in their positioning paper on public blockchains.[[croman2016scaling]] Over time, competition for the limited transaction bandwidth drives up the price to use the network. This effectively prices out small transactions, even locking up some value below what is termed the ’[dust limit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0rc3/src/primitives/transaction.h#L137)’ of unspent transactions too small to ever move again.[[delgado2018analysis]]
	- Bitcoin has developed quickly, with a [faster adoption](https://phemex.com/blogs/crypto-bitcoin-s-curve-adoption-curve) than even the internet itself.

	- It is already a mature ecosystem, with [enterprise-grade software](https://www.fortris.com/) stacks, and is seeing adoption as a [corporate treasury asset](https://bitcointreasuries.net/).
	- Adoption by civil authorities is increasing, and legislators the world over are being forced to [adopt a position](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/16/bitcoin-crashes-the-midterms-527126). California has an [explicitly Web 3 and blockchain executive order](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/05/04/governor-newsom-signs-blockchain-executive-order-to-spur-responsible-web3-innovation-grow-jobs-and-protect-consumers/) to investigate and support opportunities. Many city treasuries have [added it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/rio-de-janeiro-wants-to-become-brazil-s-cryptocurrency-capital) to their balance sheet. Honduras [has launched](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-launches-bitcoin-valley-tourist-town-santa-lucia-2022-07-29/) “Bitcoin Valley” as a tourist initiative, and the Swiss city of Lugano is launching a [huge initiative](https://twitter.com/Stadicus3000/status/1499656424422526977) alongside Tether. It is already legal tender in the country of El Salvador [[oxford2021salvador]] and the [Central African Republic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/central-african-republic-passes-bill-180910797.html?), and will be soon in [Madeira and Roatan island](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/04/07/two-new-territories-are-adopting-bitcoin/?sh=7f014ed2499a). This means it must be accepted as a means of payment, with uncertain global political legal consequences.[[katterbauer2022impact]] In places such as Panama, it simply has legal status and can be accepted without double taxation.
	- Global asset manager “Fidelity” wrote the following in their [2021 trends report](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/2021-trends-impact): “We also think there is a very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if Bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of Bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future. We therefore wouldn’t be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.”
	- #### The Bitcoin Network Software
		- There isn’t a single GitHub which can be considered the final arbiter of the development direction, because it is a distributed community effort with some [500 developers](https://decrypt.co/66740/who-are-the-fastest-growing-developer-communities-in-crypto) out of a wider ‘crypto’ pool of around 9000 contributors (the vast majority are spread across disparate Ethereum and some Solana projects). [Development and innovation continues](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/12/22/) but there is an emphasis on careful iteration to avoid damage to the network. Visualization of code commitments to the various open-source software repositories can be seen at [Bitpaint YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DT4qudqogkmbqVAQy8eFg/videos) and in Figure <a href="#fig:gource" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:gource">[fig:gource]</a>.
		  ![image](./assets/ae27e917fbfbdd847e6f9d89e5518433a4503ee0.jpg)
		- [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/) is the main historical effort (with around a dozen major contributors guiding the direction), but there are alternatives ([LibBitcoin in C++](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-node/wiki), [BTCD in Go](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd), and [BitcoinJ in Java](https://bitcoinj.github.io/getting-started)), and as innovation on layer one slows, attention is shifting to codebases which interact with the base layer asset. Much more on these later.
	- ##### Mining process overview
		- Bitcoin mining is the process of adding public transactions into the ledger, in return for two economic rewards, paid in Bitcoin. These are the mining fee and the block reward. The transactions which are added into the next ‘block’ of the chain are selected preferentially based on the fee they offer, which is up to the user trying to get their transaction into the chain. This can be within the next 10 minutes (next block), or a gamble out toward ’never’ depending how competitive the network is at any time. Miners try to find a sufficiently low result from a cryptographic hash function [[rogaway2004cryptographic]] (a random process), and upon finding it, they can take their pre-prepared ‘block’ of transactions sourced from their local queue (mempool), and add it into the chain, for confirmation by other miners. In return, they take all the fees within that mined block, and whatever the block reward is at the time. When the network started, the block reward was 50 Bitcoin, but has [halved](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/) repeatedly every 210,000 blocks (four years) and now stands at 6.25 BTC. The rate of mining is kept roughly at one block every 10 minutes, by a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks (2 weeks). This is a complex interdependent mechanism and is explained very well in [this article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network). These components are explained in slightly more detail later.
	- ##### Energy & policy response
		- Bitcoin uses a staggering amount of energy to secure the blockchain (Figure <a href="#fig:top500" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:top500">[fig:top500]</a>), and this [has climate repercussions](https://www.edmundconway.com/bitcoin-money-and-the-planet/). A simple back-of-the-envelope use of the [IEA total energy supply](https://www.iea.org/reports/key-world-energy-statistics-2021/supply) and the [Cambridge Bitcoin energy use](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index) estimate puts the network at [around 0.1%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=153+terawatt+hours+as+percentage+of+%28600+exa+joules+as+terrawatt+hours%29+) of global energy use.

		  ![image](./assets/5fd0c12ed090d4eb415c03ccc2cecb522eff6ef8.jpg)
		- It is an [industrial scale](https://www.ruetir.com/2022/03/18/riot-whinstone-the-bitcoin-farm-with-100000-computers-that-uses-excess-energy-from-an-oil-platform-to-mine-cryptocurrencies-ruetir/) global business with ‘mining companies’ investing [hundreds of millions of pounds](https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1272/marathon-digital-holdings-bitcoin-mining-fleet-to-reach) at a time in specialist [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) mining hardware and facilities. The latest purpose-designed Intel chip [touts](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/thoughts-blockchain-custom-compute-group.html#gs.pd9ofu) both Web3 and metaverse applications. This is “proof of work” and is essential to the technology, and is still thought by some to be the [best available option](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/). The [Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index) monitors this energy usage. Their [2022 report](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/bitcoin-mining-new-data-reveal-a-surprising-resurgence/) sees American mining leading globally. Even they have had a [terrible time recently](https://compassmining.io/education/the-worst-of-bitcoin-mining-in-2022/) with many companies either failing or looking likely to.
		- At the end of 2024, it is thought to be the case that the lead profitable miners are the large-scale companies who are also providing load balancing services to energy companies. This is unusual in the history of mining, and the situation will likely change over time. This is not to say that all mining is, or should be, so concentrated. Anyone running the hashing algorithm can [get lucky](https://twitter.com/ckpooldev/status/1485585814419812356) and claim the block reward. PoW ties the value of the ‘money’ component of Bitcoin directly to energy production. This is not a new idea. Henry Ford proposed an intimate tie between energy and money to create a separation of powers from government, as can be seen in Figure <a href="#fig:energyNYT" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energyNYT">[fig:energyNYT]</a>.

	- The potential ecological footprint of the network has always been a concern; Hal Finney himself was [thinking about this issue](https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1153096538) with a mature Bitcoin network as early as 2009, and [a debate](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/threads/167/#35) on the Bitcoin mailing lists called the mining process “thermodynamically perverse.” The most cited negative analysis on the matter by Mora et al. sees Bitcoin mining alone warming the planet above 2 degrees.[[mora2018bitcoin]]
	- [Proponents of the technology](https://electricmoney.org/) say that the balance shifted dramatically in 2021 with China outright banning the technology; this has forced the bulk of the energy use [toward the USA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E7489rM7Q62oXwk1f4NUlMvok9noAbpYfTynY2VTyww/edit#gid=0), and away from ‘dirty coal’.

	- Some adherents [have proposed mitigations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2N-5jY00cmteoY_puWI9oosM1foa4EQqsO1FFfIFR4/edit).[[cross2021greening]] As a worked example of [Cross and Bailey’s proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15e_a-D3x4fv3tglEzFmQ6TLQx0fZe6-iKO9Fc9SyISQ/edit#gid=0) a retail investor owning 1 BTC would have to buy around 700 shares of ‘CleanSpark’ mining company (CLSK) to make their [holding completely neutral](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r32T8p_PHTP8S781u7PhPSwehLx2VcJTaJJKesMswD0/edit#gid=0). Some more strident voices suggest that [‘ending financialization’ through the use of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@magusperivallon/a-financial-hail-mary-for-the-climate-an-argument-for-bitcoin-adoption-9c58e707d0) may be net positive for the environment at a macro level.[[bitcoinisvenice]] Indeed it may [provide a route](https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-americas-most-misunderstood-industry-opinion-1669892) to support [electrifying everything](https://mobile.twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1514072998881665027) through deployment of [flexible demand load](https://lancium.com/solutions/). This enables a kind of [‘financial battery’](https://medium.com/@theendoftheworldpartyparty/deep-bitcarbonization-c8f483716ff7) that can soak up excess capacity from overbuilt renewables (something which needs to be done). Money-saving uses like [drying wood](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/can-bitcoin-be-sustainable-inside-the-norwegian-mine-that-also-dries-wood), and even heating greenhouses ([ironically tulips](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/12/14/a-bitcoin-miner-and-tulip-grower-team-up-to-reduce-costs)) show the use case of the technology as a universal subsidy in heating applications.
	- Some projects are using the financial incentive of Bitcoin to enable trials of new infrastructure. For instance, Bhutan in the Himalayas has been quietly (or secretly!) mining Bitcoin for years and plans a [$500M fund](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/bhutan-plans-a-500-million-fund-for-crypto-mining-in-the-himalayas) to expand specifically Bitcoin mining. Makai Ocean engineering has partnered with Oceanbit Hawaii to trial [‘ocean thermal energy conversion’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion) as a possible power source for the Islands. Local subsidy initiatives may begin to [drive this kind of adoption](https://fortune.com/2022/08/14/bitcoin-has-plunged-but-texas-miners-are-flush-with-profits-thanks-to-an-unusual-arrangement-the-state-is-paying-them-not-to-mine/) as seems to be [happening in Texas](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-the-grid-generators)[[griffith2021electrify; @ercotimpact2021; @Menati2022]] and [New Hampshire](https://www.governor.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt336/files/inline-documents/sonh/cryptocurrencie-report.pdf). Brad Jones, [interim CEO of the Texas grid said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKnRfDeFgr0):
		- “As we get more renewable generation, in particular wind, which is operating at night ... we have to find a home for it, otherwise we have to turn the wind down. It’s such a great resource we shouldn’t turn it down. Bitcoin mining, or what some call crypto, has found a way to come into our markets and take some of that wind in off-peak periods. Then when we get to peak period times, they are very quick to remove themselves from the market as prices increase. The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers is fantastic. We can use that cryptocurrency to soak up that excess generation when there’s a lot of that, and find a home for more solar and more wind to come to our grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So it’s a great balancing act. Most other data centers (such as Microsoft or Amazon) have other customers to serve every other day, so they can’t just turn off. But these crypto customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high, they can remove themselves from the market. They are also helpful if we lose a generator. They can quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid.”  Flexible load balancing is entering the [mainstream news cycle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2023/01/27/why-no-one-saw-the-success-of-demand-response-coming/?) and is gaining traction in legislative bodies. This [“global energy market revolution”](https://www.citadel21.com/bitcoin-is-the-first-global-market-for-electricity-and-will-unleash-renewables) is explained by Tabatabai of Modo Energy. Incredibly, Bitcoin mining in Texas is now making the grid both more reliable and cheaper for consumers. In the UK, we have similar problems because wind power is not evenly distributed, and moving it around is complex and expensive, and the whole system needs smoothing out with [gas plants](https://archy.deberker.com/the-uk-is-wasting-a-lot-of-wind-power/).
	- There is growing interest and adoption of so-called [“stranded energy mining”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/oman-backs-u-s-firm-mining-crypto-to-cut-natural-gas-flaring) which cannot be effectively transmitted to consumers, and is thereby sold at a huge discount while also [developing power capacity](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/900mw-wind-farm-to-power-bitcoin-mining-operation/), without the [usual constraints](https://batcoinz.com/the-renewable-energy-cannot-happen-without-bitcoin-mining%ef%bf%bc/).[[bastian2021hedging]] One such example is [“Gridless” in Kenya](https://gridlesscompute.com/news/), which seeks to harness abundant green energy resources in rural areas with the hope of kick-starting economic growth. This feature of the network first came to popular attention in 2020 when Stevens, CEO of Stoneridge capital included the following text in a letter to shareholders within their [annual report](https://www.stoneridgefunds.com/documents/AnnualReport.pdf?v=4):“
		- "Bitcoin mining is the only profitable use of energy in human history that does not need to be located near human settlement to operate. The long-term implications of this are world-changing and hiding in plain sight.”
	- In addition to new build, it is possible to [re-purpose historic](https://www.curbed.com/2021/07/crypto-currency-mining-old-power-plants.html) infrastructure, and/or [reducing the carbon](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/exxon-considers-taking-gas-to-bitcoin-pilot-to-four-countries) (or [more interestingly](https://batcoinz.com/quantifying-the-potential-impact-of-bitcoin-mining-on-global-methane-emissions-4/) the methane) of existing and [abandoned infrastructure](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/27/crypto-mining-advocate-green-abandoned-gas-wells). Both the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/videos/this-start-up-catches-waste-methane-to-power-data-centres) and the UK’s Department for Energy [have expressed interest](https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a99aa482-c7d1-4ec4-82fe-5c4b16827a6d) in this use case. Adam Wright of [Vespene Energy](https://vespene.energy/) says: “You could either mine Bitcoin on one small landfill for a year, or you could plant 5 million trees and let them grow for 10 years—both of those are going to have the same environmental impact.”

	- Cheikosman, a policy analyst for the World Economic Forum (somewhat surprisingly) [wrote](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/crypto-energy-consumption/?) it “Crypto is becoming an essential part of developing a carbon-neutral energy grid and has made it economically viable to invest in, develop and build renewable energy power generation.” This is explored in detail by Ibanez et al. [[ibanez2023sok]]
	- The most cited example of building capacity before grid connection is El Salvador’s ‘volcano mining’ proposal, which is supporting their national power infrastructure plans. Uzbekistan seems to be promoting a [similar model](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uzbekistan-legalises-solar-powered-crypto-mining-2022-05-04/) with zero tax provided the Bitcoin mining companies build out their own solar infrastructure. A more poignant example is the [Mechanicville hydro plant in the USA](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php). The refurbishment of this 123-year-old power plant is being funded by Bitcoin mining. This is the [“buyer of last resort”](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/) model first [advanced by Square Inc](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/bcei-white-paper).
	- Conversely, it might be that vertical integration of Bitcoin mining [within legacy fossil fuel stations](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/oil-companies-partner-with-bitcoin-miners) gives them a new lease of life. New York State has dealt with this kind of threat by imposing a moratorium on new, fossil fuel-powered mining activity. On a global stage, something as portable and industrial as Bitcoin mining will have unintended impacts on fragile energy systems, as has happened in [South Ossetia](https://ceobs.org/environmental-governance-in-frozen-conflicts/) and [Kazakhstan](https://restofworld.org/2022/crypto-miners-fleeing-kazakhstan/) (note [Russia has stepped into this](https://thenewscrypto.com/kazakhstans-crypto-miners-to-acquire-electricity-from-russia/) mess). Undeniably the [consensus position](https://time.com/6193004/crypto-climate-impact-facts/) is that it’s overall very negative (with some caveats) and this will probably persist. Perhaps though if it’s happening anyway, then finding utility in the asset might mitigate the net harm.
	- More pragmatically, Baur and Oll found that “Bitcoin investments can be less carbon intensive than standard equity investments and thus reduce the total carbon footprint of a portfolio.” [[baur2021bitcoin]]. Perhaps of note for the near future is that KPMG, whose investment was mentioned in the introduction, also matched their position in the space with equivalent carbon offsets. This may provide an investment and growth model for others.
	- The first US-based [nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230305005096/en/TeraWulf-Announces-Energization-and-Rapid-Deployment-of-Mining-Operations-at-the-Nautilus-Facility-in-Pennsylvania) has just opened in Pennsylvania. The facility has been completed by Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of independent power producer Talon Energy. Talon Energy owns the adjacent 2.5 GW Nuclear Power Plant and has been dabbling in Bitcoin mining for some time, opening a zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility in collaboration with Terawulf in August 2021. The new facility will operate with a maximum capacity of 48 MW, drawing on excess power from the nuclear plant. By locating the mining facility on the combined 1200-acre campus, there is no intermediation by legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities, as the mining is directly connected to the power station. Cumulus Data is in the process of building two additional 48 MW facilities and has identified 18 additional Talon Energy sites with potential to host data centers directly connected to electricity generation infrastructure. In general, there is a shift in attitudes towards nuclear in the US. The enormous benefit to this model stems from the costs associated with scaling down atomic power output to match grid requirements. By co-locating in this way, the reactor can work at highest efficiency all the time, and can earn money from the generation of Bitcoin when the grid is unable to accept the energy. It is increasingly possible to find excited talk about funding smaller, more pragmatic nuclear power plants using the cost benefits of the Bitcoin mining model, though this remains untested.
	- The power commitment to the network is variously projected [to increase](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8), or [level off over time](https://assets.website-files.com/614e11526f6630959fc98679/616df63a27a7ec339f5e6a80_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf). The emission schedule of the code suggests that the energy usage will decrease exponentially over time, and indeed many analysts feel that it has peaked due to a combination of factors. It’s one of the maddening unknowns of the technology how this will all pan out. The [industry now argues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2022/04/03/is-bitcoin-really-that-bad-for-the-environment/?sh=6a3203427143) that economic pressures mean that most of the ‘hashrate’ is [generated by renewable energy](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/q4-bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-sustainable-power-mix-and-technological-efficiency/) [[blandin20203rd]]. As a recent example of this trend, Tesla (Elon Musk), Block (Twitter’s Jack Dorsey), and Blockstream (Adam Back) are teaming up to [mine with solar energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html) in Texas.
	- Paez and Cross [prepared a paper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/627aa615676bdd1d47ec97d4/62f41b9ce54e014f9869efa7_OSTP.docx.pdf) for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, submitted through the Bitcoin Policy Institute, which is a growing think tank for academics and industry leaders. Their summary points echo the assertions made here, but they provide rich additional referencing for those who wish to dig deeper into this:
		- Bitcoin’s value—its economic value and promotion of American values and American national interests—must frame any discussion of its environmental impact.
		- Bitcoin’s value is inherently tied to its consensus mechanism: proof of work.
		- While Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, its energy use is often overestimated and improperly characterized as a function of transaction volume.
		- Due to Bitcoin’s exponentially decreasing schedule of issuance, mining’s actual emissions are likely to peak at under 1% of global emissions, even if prices rise more than tenfold within the decade.
		- Mining’s profile as a consumer of energy is unique: extremely cost-sensitive, and invariant across times and locations.
		- Bitcoin mining, as a buyer of first and last resort, incentivizes the buildout of renewable power production. As a controllable load resource (CLR), Bitcoin mining also strengthens the grid, allowing it to reliably function at a high level of renewable penetration.
		- Mining’s energy use is increasingly non-rival, trending towards a diet of renewables and stranded, wasted energy resources such as flared methane.
	- [The debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LP8G-oZnEs) whether this consumption is ‘worth’ it is [complex](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/bitcoin-mining-as-a-grid-resource-its-complicated/617896/) and [rapidly evolving](https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/no-hearing-on-bitcoins-energy-use-is-complete-without-nic-carter/).
	- Useful examples of this are:
		- the [online pushback](https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/questionable-ethics-anti-bitcoin-esg-junk-science) to an academic article by PhD candidate de Vries et al. [[de2022revisiting]]
		- the assertion that the widely cited Mora et al. paper in Nature [[mora2018bitcoin]] was based on an [undergraduate class discussion](https://twitter.com/NateHawaii/status/1460706785216450560), and has had an outsized effect on global policy.
		- a [paper from the Bitcoin Policy Institute](https://rebrand.ly/v8qq1sx),
		- and the industry [open letter to the EPA](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bitcoin_Letter_to_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency.pdf).
		- this well-considered [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jyn_urso/status/1508899761319038983) by climate scientist Margot Paez.
	- It is somewhat confusing that positive views are coming only from diverse and non-specialist voices in the community, and never the academic community, but the shortcomings they point out in the supposedly considered articles such as Mora et al. [[mora2018bitcoin]] are easily verified. Academia seems [poorly positioned](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-could-never-be-invented-in-a-university) to pivot to this subject, as an ethical bar has to be established before research can commence, and the field is too new to make this an affordable task. This stuff is existentially important to the whole technology. Is a trillion-dollar asset which [potentially replaces](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-gold) the money utility of gold, but doesn’t need to be stored under guard in vaults (Figure <a href="#fig:goldmanVgold" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:goldmanVgold">3.9</a>), worth the equivalent power consumption of clothes dryers in North America? Probably not with the current level of adoption, but this is an experiment in replacing global money. If that were to happen then Bitcoin would be around 50 times more efficient than the current system according to Khazzaka. [[khazzaka2022bitcoin]] To be clear it’s not the position of this book that replacing Fiat money is a good idea, but the experiment is being run regardless. This is explored in [[money]].

	- Legislators globally are [starting to codify](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/legal.html) their positions on proof of work as a technology (including Bitcoin). US States are variously [supporting](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/HC00089I.htm) or constricting the technology, according to [state legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/cryptocurrency-2021-legislation.aspx). Notably, New York has [banned new carbon-intensive](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A7389) mining facilities for 2 years, while rust and farm belt states with energy build-out problems are [providing incentives](https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/texas-governor-abbott-turns-to-bitcoin-miners-to-bolster-the-grid-and-his-re-election) and passing legislation to protect [mining data centers](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=hb1799). At the federal level, the White House has strongly signaled their concerns about the sector [in a report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ERP-2023.pdf). Many of the points in the report are fair and true, and reflect things said in this knowledge base (which pre-dates the report). It’s worth picking out the conclusion of that section verbatim:
		- “Innovation in financial services brings both risks and opportunities for the broader economy. It can challenge business models and existing industries, but it cannot challenge basic economic principles, such as what makes an asset effective as money and the incentives that give rise to run risk. Although the underlying technologies are a clever solution for the problem of how to execute transactions without a trusted authority, crypto assets currently do not offer widespread economic benefits. They are largely speculative investment vehicles and are not an effective alternative to fiat currency. Also, they are too risky at present to function as payment instruments or to expand financial inclusion. Even so, it is possible that their underlying technology may still find productive uses in the future as companies and governments continue to experiment with DLT. In the meantime, some crypto assets appear to be here to stay, and they continue to cause risks for financial markets, investors, and consumers. Much of the activity in the crypto asset space is covered by existing regulations and regulators are expanding their capabilities to bring a large number of new entities under compliance (SEC 2022). Other parts of the crypto asset space require coordination by various agencies and deliberations about how to address the risks they pose (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022a). Certain innovations, such as FedNow and a potential U.S. CBDC, could help bring the U.S. financial infrastructure into the digital era in a clear and simple way, without the risks or irrational exuberance brought by crypto assets. Hence, continued investments in the Nation’s financial infrastructure have the potential to offer significant benefits to consumers and businesses, but regulators must apply the lessons that civilization has learned, and thus rely on economic principles, in regulating crypto assets.”
	- Reading between the lines suggests that strong regulation is coming. Indeed, the [SEC is now suing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000051/coin-20230322.htm) the major tech company in the space, Coinbase, while closing a bank servicing the sector, and signaling that stable coins may be unregistered securities in law. The report itself has no ‘teeth’ but is likely a sign of things to come. There is purportedly $2.4B [entering the regulation ecosystems](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP23/20230329/115576/HHRG-118-AP23-TTF-GenslerG-20230329.pdf) to enhance regulatory oversight. In actual fact, because of the nature of the federation of states, it is likely that a variety of different approaches in law will be taken across the geography and the sector seems to have responded with a shrug. As an aside, the report contains an excellent taxonomy of digital assets from Hoffman (Figure <a href="#fig:PresidentTaxonomy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:PresidentTaxonomy">3.10</a>).

	- Conversely, the recent “[Climate and energy implications](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/)” report is parts positive and parts negative about proof of work, and leaves the door open to a legislative clampdown. This is most notable in a [White House proposal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/) to tax Bitcoin mining at 30%, a plan which will destroy much of the US-based mining industry over the coming years. Carter provides a [detailed response](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/comments-on-the-white-house-report-on-the-climate-implications-of-crypto-mining-8d65d30ec942) to the tardy scientific analysis in the report. Perhaps most interestingly it notes the potential of methane mitigation as mentioned earlier. It is conceivable that methane mitigation alone could provide a route forward for the technology. The report says: “The crypto-asset industry can potentially use stranded methane gas, which is the principal component of natural gas, to generate electricity for mining. Methane gas is produced during natural gas drilling and transmission, and by oil wells, landfills, sewage treatment, and agricultural processes. Methane is a potent GHG that can result in 27 to 30 times the global warming potential of CO2 over a 100-year time frame, and is about 80 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year time frame. Reducing methane emissions can slow near-term climate warming, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration released the U.S. methane emissions reduction action plan in 2021. Venting and flaring methane at oil and natural gas wells wastes 4% of global methane production. In 2021, venting and flaring methane emitted the equivalent of 400 million metric tons of CO2, representing about 0.7% of global GHG emissions. This methane is vented or flared because of the high cost of constructing permanent pipelines or electricity transmission that could transport the methane or its potential electricity generation from remote oil and gas operations to end-users, or because of the high cost of installing equipment on older landfills. Crypto-asset companies are now exploring ways to use electricity generation from vented and flared methane at oil and gas wells and at landfills. While the EPA and the Department of the Interior have proposed new rules to reduce methane for oil and natural gas operations, crypto-asset mining operations that capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate, by converting the potent methane to CO2 during combustion. Mining operations that replace existing methane flares would not likely affect CO2 emissions since this methane would otherwise be flared and converted to CO2. Mining operations, though, could potentially be more reliable and more efficient at converting methane to CO2. While such operations can reduce wasted methane, another option is low-cost recovery of methane using existing vapor capture technologies at oil and gas wells, which can reduce global methane emissions up to 50% by 2030.”
	- The EU has just voted to add the whole of ‘crypto’, including PoW, to the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. This EU-wide classification system provides investors with guidance as to the sustainability of a given technology and can have a meaningful impact on the flows of investment. With that said the report and addition of PoW is not slated until 2025, and it is by no means clear what the analysis will be by that point. Meanwhile they’re tightening controls of transactions, on which there will be more detail later. For its part, the European Central Bank has come out [in favor of strong constraints](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_3~d9614ea8e6.en.html) on crypto mining. They use the [widely discredited](https://medium.com/crescofin/the-reports-of-bitcoin-environmental-damage-are-garbage-5a93d32c2d7) “digiconimist” estimates to assert that mining operations are [disproportionately damaging to the environment](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_3~d9614ea8e6.en.html).
	- We have seen that China has cracked down hard on the technology, banning mining and pressuring holders of the assets. They have unwound this somewhat, and based on past experience it seems that they will continue to nuance their position as they seek adoption of their own digital currency. As much as 20% of all mining activity is now suspected to take place within China.
	- Russia is moving to ban the whole technology, most especially Bitcoin, in response to capital flight concerns.

	- In India, there has been confusion for years as more “local” law vies with confusing central government signaling. It has variously been banned and unbanned, and is now subject to punitive tax. The central bank of India is [strongly in favor](http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/179/AS10.pdf) of a complete ban. Ajay Seth, secretary of the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs recently said it: “We have gone through a deep dive consulting with not just the domestic and institutional stakeholders but also organizations like IMF and World Bank.... Simultaneously we are also beginning our work for some sort of a global regulation (to determine) what role India can play... Whatever we do, even if we go to the extreme form, the countries that have chosen to prohibit, they can’t succeed unless there is a global consensus.”
	- It feels like a global political response is just around the corner, but reputable voices in the community suggest that it always feels this way. There is more detail on this in the Money chapter later in the book.
	- ## The Bitcoin Network Software
	- There isn't a single GitHub which can be considered the final arbiter of the development direction, because it is a distributed community effort with some [500 developers](https://decrypt.co/66740/who-are-the-fastest-growing-developer-communities-in-crypto) out of a wider 'crypto' pool of around 9000 contributors (the vast majority are spread across disparate Ethereum and some Solana projects). [Development and innovation continues](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/12/22/) but there is an emphasis on careful iteration to avoid damage to the network. Visualisation of code commitments to the various open source software repositories can be seen at [Bitpaint youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DT4qudqogkmbqVAQy8eFg/videos) and in Figure [3.14](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F14 "Figure 3.14 ‣ 3.4.1 The Bitcoin Network Software ‣ 3.4 Bitcoin ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art").
	- ![Figure 3.14: [Bitpaint](https://github.com/bitpaint/bitcoin-gources): Contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Reused with permission.](../assets/gource.jpg)
	- [Bitcoin core](https://github.com/bitcoin/) is the main historical effort (with around a dozen major contributors guiding the direction), but there are alternatives ([LibBitcoin in C++](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-node/wiki), [BTCD in Go](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd), and [BitcoinJ in Java](https://bitcoinj.github.io/getting-started)), and as innovation on layer one slows, attention is shifting to codebases which interact with the base layer asset. Much more on these later.

	- In India there has been confusion for years as more "local" law vies with confusing central government signalling. It has variously been banned and unbanned, and is now subject to punitive tax. The central bank of India is [strongly in favour](http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/179/AS10.pdf) of a complete ban. Ajay Seth, secretary of the Finance Ministry's Department of Economic Affairs recently said ["We have gone through a deep dive consulting with not just the domestic and institutional stakeholders but also organizations like IMF and World Bank.... Simultaneously we are also beginning our work for some sort of a global regulation (to determine) what role India can play... Whatever we do, even if we go to the extreme form, the countries that have chosen to prohibit, they can't succeed unless there is a global consensus"]
	- It feels like a global political response is just around the corner, but reputable voices in the community suggest that it always feels this way. There is more detail on this in Money chapter later in the book.
- ##  Risks and mitigations
	- Looking across the whole sector, this paragraph from the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) [sums everything up](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2022e3.htm):
	- ["...it is now becoming clear that crypto and DeFi have deeper structural limitations that prevent them from achieving the levels of efficiency, stability or integrity required for an adequate monetary system. In particular, the crypto universe lacks a nominal anchor, which it tries to import, imperfectly, through stablecoins. It is also prone to fragmentation, and its applications cannot scale without compromising security, as shown by their congestion and exorbitant fees. Activity in this parallel system is, instead, sustained by the influx of speculative coin holders. Finally, there are serious concerns about the role of unregulated intermediaries in the system. As they are deep-seated, these structural shortcomings are unlikely to be amenable to technical fixes alone. This is because they reflect the inherent limitations of a decentralised system built on permissionless blockchains."]
	- [[Lightning and Similar L2]] is still considered to be experimental and not completely battle tested. There have been various attacks and a major double spend attack may be possible \[[78]\], but there have been no major problems in the years it's been running with careful design choices and cybersecurity best practice it it likely a production ready component of our planning.

- # Scraps to be integrated
	-
		- ### Sociopaths everywhere
		- In the wake of the rampant crime spree by Sam Bankman-Freid and his top teams at Alameda research and the Bahamas registered exchange ‘FTX’ the whole industry has suffered, and will continue to suffer, seismic shocks. There is a chance the sector will never recover, and that we have already seen the top of the hype bubble. Fortunately this doesn’t diminish our use cases for these technologies, as we were never planning to speculate with the asset, but rather use the network. As a side note it is generally accepted that convention money is far more [popular for crime.](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf)
		- [COPA vs Craig Wright: The Identity Trial (lopp.net)](https://blog.lopp.net/copa-vs-craig-wright-identity-trial/) -
	- ### Digital assets
	- For digital assets more generally it is useful to look at the recent “whole government executive order” signed by President Biden early in 2022. It was mainly framed in terms of “responsible innovation, and leadership” in the new space. The resulting, “Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets” is a product of multi agency collaboration and can be seen as 9 reports and a summary document, and has been long anticipated. The summary itself is neither particularly comprehensive nor a framework, and mainly serves to identifies high level risks, aspirations, and challenges, and strongly hints toward eventual development of a “digital dollar” (CBDC, expanded later).
	-
		- The risks section of the original executive order shows how legislators are framing this, so it’s useful to break down here.
	-
		- Consumer and business protections. This is likely to pertain to custodians and is much needed. Misselling is rife. Security presents a challenge.
	- Systemic risk, and market integrity are a concern. The legislators clearly worry about contagion risks from the sector.
	- Illicit finance (criminality and sanction busting etc) are a concern, but not particularly front and centre[79]. Criminality in 2021 was a mere 0.15% of transactions according to Chainalysis, but this number varies year to year. There are claims that Iran have begun official overseas buying with cryptocurrencies, but again, the numbers are small. One of the better sections of the work is the US treasury department’s recently published ‘National Risk Assessments for Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing’. This is a comprehensive report and speaks to careful research across the space. It is broken into three parts. Perhaps surprisingly, while they do see activity in these areas, they do not rate the risk as very significant. Cash remains the main problem for illicit funding. There is some talk that the nature of public blockchain analysis allows greater oversight of these tools and that this is to the advantage of government and civil enforcement agencies.
	- Highlighting the need for international coordination suggests they are mindful of jurisdictional arbitrage. The partial regulatory capture of these technologies, where activity flows to globally more lenient legislative regimes, continues to be a concern. Many of the centralised exchanges for instance are located in tax havens such as Malta. As the world catches up with these products it is likely that this will be smoothed out.
	- Climate goals, diversity, equality and inclusion are mentioned. It seems that the “environment” aspect of ESG is more important then “social” and “governance” at this time.
	- Privacy and human rights are mentioned.
	- Energy policy is highlighted, including grid management and reliability, energy efficiency incentives and standards, and sources of energy supply.
	- The latest summary report resulting from the above guidance actually adds little tangible meat to the bones. This possibly reflects the complexity of these issues. The recommendations seem to be broadly as follows, and are really a copy/paste of the executive order.
	-
		- Carry on doing research into central bank digital currencies, but there’s no particular rush.
	- Support development of better instant payment methods both at home and globally.
	- Ensure consumer and systemic protections.
	- More monitoring, civil and criminal prosecutions.
	- Issue more rules and clarity in response to risks (this is actually likely net positive as rules are currently unclear).
	- Improve global reporting on users (KYC/AML).
	- The government rhetoric to date in the USA can be seen to be converging on an understanding of the technology, at different rates in different parts of government. One thing that seems to shine through is their own perception of their global leadership on legislation on these matters. They seems to assume that what they decide will guide the world, and this may be true through their KYC/AML pressures.
	-
		- A recent proposed bi-partisan bill in the USA will likely help inform global law, though it is unlikely to pass itself. It encourages the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange by applying a tax exemption on transactions of less than $200. The issue of whether an asset is a commodity (a raw material thing) or a security (a promise) is left to a couple of major government agencies to unpick, with corresponding reporting requirements. Crucially for this book these nascent bills all regard both Bitcoin and Ethereum as sufficiently decentralised to qualify as commodities, meaning they would enjoy more lenient oversight. Far more likely to pass is the proposed DCCPA bill which has senior lawmaker support and would see commodities in the space regulated in such a way that trading of it could be halted in the USA. In this line of policy, exchanges will be required to do far more reporting, and would be penalised for trading against their customers. DOAs and DeFi are the big potential losers. In a maddening twist the Office of Government Ethics in the USA has banned anyone who owns digital assets from working on the legislation. This is an exceptional move and likely to result in poorly crafted laws in the first instance.
	-
		- The most recent and troubling example is the US ban on any Ethereum assets which have been through a “mixer service” that obfuscates history. This is a huge constraint on the code and smart contract itself, not just sanctions against individuals. It has ‘free speech’ and constitutional implications [80]. More such actions and arrests of developers are feared. It has led to Circle (who issue the USDC stablecoin) blacklisting every address sanctioned by the US government. Centrally issued digital assets are obviously neither uncensorable nor permissionless. This intersects (again) with the whole question of what decentralisation means and how effective it can be in it’s stated goal of circumventing global policies.
	-
		- 3.9.3Bitcoin specifically
	- In addition it’s useful for this document to focus more on the technical challenges to the Bitcoin network.
	-
		- The block reward is reduced every 4 years (epochs). This means a portion of the mining reward is trending to zero, and nobody knows what effect this will have on the incentives for securing the network through proof of work [81]. It is increasingly being discussed as the major eventual problem for the network.
	- Stablecoins are a vital transitional technology (described later) but do not meaningfully exist yet on the Bitcoin network. This may change.
	- Bitcoin lacks privacy by design. All transactions are publicly viewable. This is a major drag to the concept of BTC as a money. Upgrade of the network is possible, and has indeed been achieved for a Bitcoin fork called Litecoin [82].
	- The Lightning network (described later) has terrible UX design at this time.
	- The basic ‘usability’ of the network is still poor in the main. Any problems which users experience demand a steep learning curve and risk loss of funds. There is obviously no technical support number people can call.
	- Only around one billion unspent transactions can be generated a year on the network. This means that it might become impossible for everyone on the planet to have their own Bitcoin address (with it’s associated underpinning UTXO).
	- Chip manufacture is concentrated in only a few companies and countries, as identified by Matthew Pines.
	- Potential constraints on monetary policy flexibility.
	- Future protocol changes.
	- Unanticipated effects on the domestic and international energy system.
	- Vulnerability to adversary attacks are widely studied[83, 84, 85, 86], and still pretty much completely speculative because of the complex nature of the attack surface.
	- Mining tends toward economy of scale concentration. Many are already on their own specialised network to connect to one another.
	- Future hard forks. There will doubtless be pressure to fork the code to add inflation, or ESG mitigations, or to fix the UNIX clock issue in 2106. Each fork is a risk.
	- Other unknown, unanticipated risks given Bitcoin’s limited 13-year history.
	- There is a “non-zero” chance that Bitcoin is a complex government intelligence agency construct, much like Crpto AG was toward the end of the last century [87].

	- Swap Service is an orderbook that allows for submarine swaps over Nostr, enabling Bitcoin users to earn a yield on their Bitcoin. Submarine swaps allow for the swapping of funds on Lightning for funds on the base layer and vice versa, without the need for opening or closing channels or giving custody of funds to other people. Swap Service also enables channel rebalancing and is the foundation for wallets and services like Muun, Lightning Loop, and Boltz Exchange. Anyone who runs an LND Lightning node can become a yield chaser by running Swap Service on their computer and hooking it up to their node. Yield chasers can set parameters and earn a fee for swaps. Swap Service is available on both the mainnet and testnet. https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/swap-service-submarine-swaps-over-nostr/

	-
		- On May 16, Lightning Labs announced Taproot Assets v0.2, the newest version of its scalable protocol to issue assets on Bitcoin and Lightning. Taproot Assets v0.2 has a core set of features that enable developers to issue assets and bitcoinize assets in a chain-efficient manner. This specific version offers a variety of useful features, such us vPSBT support for send and receive, Universe APIs for asset discovery and multi-asset transactions to save chain space. The team called all bitcoin and Lightning developers to test the code, give feedback and start building on Taproot Assets.  The announcement has generated feedback from users on Twitter, including comments calling for Bolt12, RGB, and Podcast Token. https://twitter.com/lightning/status/1658497809895809025
	-
		- The Swap Service is an order book designed for performing submarine swaps over the Nostr protocol. It provides users with a way to earn yield on their bitcoin holdings. Submarine swaps allow lightning users to swap funds on the lightning network for funds on the base layer, or vice versa, without opening and closing channels and without the need to give custody of their money to other people. They are also beneficial for channel rebalancing and create the foundation for important wallets and services such as Muun, Lightning Loop and Boltz Exchange. Any person running an LND lightning node can run the Swap Service on their computer to become a yield chaser, setting parameters, such as how much sats they are willing to swap and the fee for swaps, with the Swap Service providing a simple tool to execute these actions. The Swap Service website includes a demo video and instruction for use on the mainnet or testnet. https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/swap-service-submarine-swaps-over-nostr/

		- Diamond Hands has released an alpha version of Shiro Wallet, which is compatible with RGB protocol and can be added easily to other services by calling endpoints for the wallet. It is an open-source, self-hosted RGB wallet for the Bitcoin blockchain. Shiro Wallet can issue, send and receive fungible RGB tokens, which allows users to experiment with the protocol and gain first-hand experience. The wallet is a web-server wallet and can be integrated easily with other services. It is the first RGB wallet available on Umbrel, a popular Bitcoin node management platform. However, the current form of Shiro Wallet is still very rough and alpha and only available on testnet for now. https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/shiro-wallet-umbrel-release/

		- The nbd-wtf/soma repository on GitHub is a demo Spacechain that allows users to issue and transfer non-fungible assets on a fully-fledged blockchain that does not require any shitcoins to be created or spam to be dumped into the Bitcoin chain. The blockchain is designed using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and runs on signet. The repository includes a Docker container with everything pre-packaged for running the Spacechain demo, along with a tutorial. There are also hosted tools available for users who just want to see something happen. The repository is primarily written in Scala and JavaScript, with smaller portions written in Dockerfile, HTML, Go, Shell, and Makefile. https://github.com/nbd-wtf/soma

		- BRC-20 is an experiment to test if ordinal theory can facilitate fungibility on Bitcoin. It allows for the deployment, minting, and transfer of token amounts through a JSON file inscription, enabling the tracking of rudimentary token balances on Bitcoin. BRC-20 defines ticker length as four characters, with little to no restrictions on character type. The deployment contract sets a maximum "lim* amount for the token, which anyone can mint after. The activity around BRC-20s remained modest until early March, but exploded in late April, leading to Bitcoin network transactions surpassing regular Bitcoin transactions for two days straight. However, this creates a significant risk to the ecosystem as third-party services keep track of balances and token indexes instead of the Bitcoin blockchain or ord client, potentially exposing third party security to systemic risk. The ecosystem is accelerating with DeFi-type *liquidity pool" standards popping up as it mirrors the early stages of the previous crypto cycle before DeFi Summer. This is an ongoing and rapidly developing story, which requires continued tracking of the Ordinals ecosystem. https://blog.ordinalhub.com/brc-20-mania/

		- |A new open-source Bitcoin blockchain analyzer is being developed to provide regular Bitcoin users with tools to research their transactions and avoid high fees charged by analytics companies. A recent post found that over 80% of inscriptions created in early-mid May 2023 belonged to a single entity, controlled by a single private key, belonging to a possible user of Unisat. The centralisation of control means a single entity can significantly impact the entire Blockchain regime, with the tests highlighting worrying vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin network. Further research is required to address the issue. https://block21m.substack.com/p/most-bitcoin-inscriptions-belong-d6d

	- Ark is a privacy-focused off-chain protocol that offers anonymity similar to the classic Chaumian eCash system. However, unlike eCash, transactions made through Ark are backed by actual bitcoins, making it more secure. Compared to Lightning, Ark is a liquidity network that consumes significantly less on-chain footprint and allows recipients to receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity or revealing their identity. Ark also mimics the on-chain wallet UX but does not require transactions to be on-chain and does not introduce inbound liquidity constraints. Compared to validity rollups, Ark has higher throughput as it does not require on-chain data per transaction. While in theory, Ark service providers can double-spend their pool transactions while they sit on mempool, users can redeem their previously redeemed coins through a hypothetical data manipulation opcode in case of double-spending. Overall, Ark offers a more secure and private way to make transactions that is faster and more efficient than other methods available. https://www.arkpill.me/faq

There is a chance the sector will never recover, and that we have already seen the top of the hype bubble. Fortunately this doesn't diminish our use cases for these technologies, as we were never planning to speculate with the asset, but rather use the network.

		- #### 3.9.2 Digital assets
	- For digital assets more generally it is useful to look at the recent ["whole government executive order"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) signed by President Biden early in 2022.

One of the better sections of the work is the US treasury     department's recently published 'National Risk Assessments for Money     Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing'. This     is a comprehensive report and speaks to careful research across the     space. It is broken into [three     parts](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0619).     Perhaps surprisingly, while they do see activity in these areas,     they do not rate the risk as very significant. Cash remains the main     problem for illicit funding. There is some talk that the nature of     public blockchain analysis allows greater oversight of these tools     and that this is to the advantage of government and civil     enforcement agencies.     Highlighting the need for international coordination suggests they     are mindful of jurisdictional arbitrage. The partial regulatory     capture of these technologies, where activity flows to globally more     lenient legislative regimes, continues to be a concern. Many of the     centralised exchanges for instance are located in tax havens such as     Malta. As the world catches up with these products it is likely that     this will be smoothed out.     Climate goals, diversity, equality and inclusion are mentioned. It     seems that the "environment" aspect of ESG is more important then     "social" and "governance" at this time.     Privacy and human rights are mentioned.     Energy policy is highlighted, including grid management and     reliability, energy efficiency incentives and standards, and sources     of energy supply.
	- The [latest summary report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) resulting from the above guidance actually adds little tangible meat to the bones. This possibly reflects the complexity of these issues. The recommendations seem to be broadly as follows, and are really a copy/paste of the executive order.
	- Carry on doing research into central bank digital currencies, but     there's no particular rush.     Support development of better instant payment methods both at home     and globally.     Ensure consumer and systemic protections.     More monitoring, civil and criminal prosecutions.     Issue more rules and clarity in response to risks (this is actually     likely net positive as rules are currently unclear).     Improve global reporting on users (KYC/AML).
	- The government rhetoric to date in the USA can be seen to be converging on an understanding of the technology, at different rates in different parts of government. One thing that seems to shine through is their own perception of their global leadership on legislation on these matters. They seems to assume that what they decide will guide the world, and this may be true through their KYC/AML pressures.
	- A recent proposed [bi-partisan bill in the USA](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/heres-whats-in-senator-lummis-bitcoin-bill) will likely help inform global law, though it is unlikely to pass itself. It encourages the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange by applying a tax exemption on transactions of less than \$200. The issue of whether an asset is a commodity (a raw material thing) or a security (a promise) is left to a couple of major government agencies to unpick, with corresponding reporting requirements. Crucially for this book these nascent bills all regard both Bitcoin and Ethereum as sufficiently decentralised to [qualify as commodities](https://www.coincenter.org/a-new-senate-bill-focuses-on-cryptocurrency-exchanges-heres-what-developers-and-users-should-keep-an-eye-on/), meaning they would enjoy more lenient oversight. Far more likely to pass is the [proposed DCCPA bill](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/crypto_one-pager1.pdf) which has senior lawmaker support and would see commodities in the space regulated in such a way that trading of it could be halted in the USA. In this line of policy, exchanges will be required to do far more reporting, and would be penalised for trading against their customers. DOAs and DeFi are the big potential losers. In a maddening twist the Office of Government Ethics in the USA has banned anyone who owns digital assets from working on the legislation. This is an exceptional move and likely to result in poorly crafted laws in the first instance.
	- The most recent and troubling example is the US ban on any Ethereum assets which have been through a "mixer service" [that obfuscates history](https://www.coincenter.org/u-s-treasury-sanction-of-privacy-tools-places-sweeping-restrictions-on-all-americans/). This is a huge constraint on the code and smart contract itself, not just sanctions against individuals. It has ['free speech'](https://hoffmang9.github.io/free-speech/the-history-code-is-free-speech.html) and constitutional implications \[[80]\]. More such actions and [arrests of developers](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-investigators-say-developer-of-tornado-cash-arrested/a-62793823) are feared. It has led to Circle (who issue the USDC stablecoin) blacklisting every [address sanctioned by the US government](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220808). Centrally issued digital assets are obviously neither uncensorable nor permissionless. This intersects (again) with the whole question of what decentralisation means and how effective it can be in it's stated goal of circumventing global policies.

	- In addition it's useful for this document to focus more on the technical challenges to the Bitcoin network.
	- The block reward is reduced every 4 years (epochs). This means a     portion of the mining reward is trending to zero, and nobody knows     what effect this will have on the incentives for [securing the     network](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget-ii-mm/)     through proof of work     \[[81]\]. It is     increasingly [being     discussed](https://cryptostackers.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value?sd=pf&s=r)     as the major eventual problem for the network.     Stablecoins are a vital transitional technology (described later)     but do not meaningfully exist yet on the Bitcoin network. This may     change.     Bitcoin lacks privacy by design. All transactions are publicly     viewable. This is a major drag to the concept of BTC as a money.     Upgrade of the network is possible, and has indeed been achieved for     a Bitcoin fork called Litecoin     \[[82]\].     The Lightning network (described later) has terrible UX design at     this time.     The basic 'usability' of the network is still poor in the main. Any     problems which users experience demand a steep learning curve and     risk loss of funds. There is obviously no technical support number     people can call.     Only around one billion unspent transactions can be generated a year     on the network. This means that it might become impossible for     everyone on the planet to have their own Bitcoin address (with it's     associated underpinning UTXO).     Chip manufacture is concentrated in only a few companies and     countries, as identified by [Matthew     Pines](https://www.btcpolicy.org/authors/matthew-pines).     Potential constraints on monetary policy flexibility.     Unanticipated effects on the domestic and international energy     system.     Vulnerability to adversary attacks are [widely     studied](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-attacks-explained)\[[83],     [84],     [85],     [86]\], and still     pretty much completely speculative because of the complex nature of     the attack surface.     Mining tends toward economy of scale concentration. Many are already     on their [own specialised network](https://bitcoinfibre.org/) to     connect to one another.     Future hard forks. There will doubtless be pressure to fork the code     to add inflation, or ESG mitigations, or to fix the UNIX clock issue     in 2106. Each fork is a risk.     Other unknown, unanticipated risks given Bitcoin's limited 13-year     history.     There is a "non-zero" chance that Bitcoin is a complex government     intelligence agency construct, [much like Crpto AG     was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG) toward the end of the     last century     \[[87]\].
