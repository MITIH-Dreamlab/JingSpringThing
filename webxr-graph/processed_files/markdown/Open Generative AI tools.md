	- ## Opensource vs Freeware in AI:
		- This is a hot, and also seemingly endless debate that has been going on for years.
		- Open-source AI allows users to access, modify, and distribute the source code **and training methods** for free, promoting collaboration and community-driven development. Popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch fall under this category.
		- Free-to-use, on the other hand, is copyrighted software distributed without charge, but with limited rights to modify or distribute. Meta Llama 2 falls into that catagory.
		- Feel free to get right into the weeds with the [Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM: Awesome-LLM: a curated list of Large Language Model (github.com)](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM)
	- ## Large Language models:
		- ### **"AI is the high interest credit card of product development"**
			- There's SO much activity. [Thousands and thousands](https://llm.extractum.io/) of merges and models and LoRAs oh my...
				- Some of these are from legit labs are are fabulous.
				- [[Deepseek]] (Chinese) [[Falcon]] (UAE) [[Mistral]] (France) [[Red Pyjama]] [[Microsoft Models]] [[Poro]] (Finland) and more.
			- It's confusing because people are "gaming" the evaluation tools, so nobody really knows what's good.
			- Best to ask people who know, and accept you're going to be changing the back end of your system a lot.
			- You can pick a size and utility of model and get a long way, but do you need to?
			- Low code [flowise](https://flowiseai.com/) demo which you probably saw earlier.
				- It is multi-modal, can generate images like OpenAI, and use audio bi-driectionally, like OpenAI.
				- It is a drop in replacement, so crucially it can serve as a BACKUP
				- This is doable, but probably don't do it.
