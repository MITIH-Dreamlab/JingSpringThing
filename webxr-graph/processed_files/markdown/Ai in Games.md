	- Traditional engines like Unity, [[Unreal]], [[Roblox]] , and [[NVIDIA Omniverse]] may become outdated [[Disruption]].
		- They're something like 15 years old and designed for a past era of computing.
		- The rise of generative AI, cloud computing, and new spatial platforms is poised to transform 3D creation.
		- Future engines might start with simple text prompts for creation, making them more accessible and reducing barriers for new creators.
		- Proposed engines should be modular, cloud-based, and adaptable to different project needs, avoiding the bloat of current engines.
		- There is opportunity for the traditional engines to pivot here, but they are struggling with their size already.
		- A key feature will be real-time collaboration and version control in a cloud-based environment.
		- This suggests that user experience in these engines should be flexible and cater to different skill levels and roles.
		- New engines might initially focus on specific genres, art styles, or platforms, rather than trying to cover all use cases.
		- The interoperable [Open Universal Scene Descriptor](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) might be the key enabler.
		- There could be significant change in the entertainment industry, with more diverse and interactive content as a result of these advancements.

		- Plenty of fun tools for game makers, but distributors are quite ossified, and access to distribution may be patchy.
