		- [Cristiano Amon: generative AI is ‘evolving very, very fast’ into mobile devices (FT.com)](https://www.ft.com/content/dbc0984b-4801-4aeb-bcab-480704c34161) highlights the necessity for dedicated computing resources in mobile devices.
			- As Amon explains, while tasks can be executed on a CPU or GPU, these processors are often preoccupied with other functions. This multitasking can hinder performance when running complex AI algorithms.
			- To address this challenge, there is a push towards implementing dedicated accelerated computing solutions. This includes the integration of Neural Processing Units (NPUs), which are specifically designed to handle AI workloads efficiently.
			- NPUs enable faster processing speeds and lower power consumption compared to traditional CPUs and GPUs, making them ideal for real-time applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and augmented reality experiences.
			- The evolution of these technologies signifies a pivotal shift in how we approach AI deployment across various platforms, particularly in mobile environments where resource constraints are prevalent.
		- You’re going to see devices launch in early 2024 with a number of [[Proprietary Large Language Models]] use cases. It has the potential to create a new upgrade cycle on smartphones. And what we want is that eventually you’re going to say, you know, “I’ve been keeping my phone for the past four years . . . Now I need to buy a new phone because I really want this gen AI capability
		- VR and AI
			- We are seeing gen AI coming into VR. We see an incredible potential for augmented reality and mixed reality glasses, especially as you use audio and large language models as an interface. We have been very bullish about spatial computing being the new computing platform, and we see a lot of promising developments coming: we see what Meta is doing, we see what is happening on the Android ecosystem with Google and Samsung. We are just at the beginning.
			- Bloomberg reports Sam Altman is in talks to raise money for a ‘global’ network of fabricators building hardware for AI. Sam Altman's plan to establish a global network of AI chip factories could revolutionize the tech industry, reducing dependence on existing semiconductor giants and ensuring a steady supply of AI advancements.

- # Edge
	- Edge compute refers to the practice of processing and analyzing data as close to the source as possible, which is typically at the edge of a network. This approach aims to reduce latency and network congestion by performing computations and running applications on devices such as sensors, gateways, or edge servers located near the data source. By moving computational tasks closer to where the data is generated, edge compute enables real-time and low-latency decision-making.
	- Edge AI, also known as AI at the edge or on-device AI, refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on edge devices. By bringing AI capabilities closer to the data source, Edge AI eliminates the need to transmit large volumes of data to the cloud for processing. This approach enables real-time inference and decision-making directly on devices with limited computing resources, such as smartphones, drones, or IoT devices. Edge AI has several advantages, including reduced latency, improved privacy and security, offline functionality, and the ability to operate in disconnected or bandwidth-constrained environments.
	- Fog compute, on the other hand, extends the concept of edge compute by introducing a hierarchical architecture. It involves distributing computing resources, storage, and applications between the cloud and edge devices. In the fog computing model, intermediate fog nodes are deployed between edge devices and the cloud, enabling them to process and store data. This approach reduces the need for data to be transmitted to traditional data centers or the cloud, allowing for faster response times, increased security, and better bandwidth utilization.
	- Overall, the combination of edge compute, fog compute, and edge AI introduces a distributed computing paradigm that brings processing, storage, and intelligence closer to the data source. This not only improves performance and efficiency but also enables new use cases and applications in various domains, including IoT, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
	- These systems will drive the compute to less ‘constrained’ but somewhat less capable AI systems, distributing the access but increasing risks. [[Update Cycle]]

They have perhaps removed “gorillaarm syndrome”[[boring2009scroll]] where hands in the sky interfaces arepotentially uncomfortable over long periods.[[hansberger2017dispelling]]Nathan Gitter and Amy DeDonato from the Apple Design team [introducespatial design for thedevice](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/).
	- ##### Spatial operating systems
		- - Enabling users to design experiences not previously possible.
		- - The presentation outlines how to keep apps familiar, be human-centered, take advantage of space, enhance immersion, and make apps authentic to the platform.
		- - The world serves as an infinite canvas for new apps and games.
		- - Existing app elements should be kept familiar with common elements like sidebars, tabs, and search fields.
		- - In a spatial platform, interfaces are placed within windows to make them easily accessible and part of the user’s surroundings.
	- ##### Windows in Spatial Design
		- - Windows are designed with a new visual language, made of a glass material that provides contrast with the world, awareness of surroundings, and adapts to different lighting conditions.
		- - Windows can be moved, closed, and resized by users, with windows facing the user during movement.
		- - Windows are flexible and can be resized to fit comfortably within the user’s view.
		- - Choosing Window Size and Layout Windows are designed to be flexible, adapting to content, and the window size should be chosen based on this. Windows can change size dynamically based on context.
		- - Apps can use multiple windows to display content side by side or show distinct actions, but should ideally stick to a single window to avoid user overwhelm.
	- ##### Designing with Points
		- - Interfaces are designed with points to ensure they scale well and remain legible at different distances.
		- - Points allow designers to set the size of interface elements with familiar units. Human-Centered Design
		- - Good spatial design places the user at the center, accounting for their field of view and movement.
		- - The most important content should be placed in the center of the field of view and use landscape layouts.
		- - Ergonomics should also be considered, placing content along a natural line of sight for comfort.
		- - Designers should avoid placing content behind users or anchoring content to their view as it can be disorienting.
		- - Spatial design should aim to create stationary experiences that require minimal movement from users.
		- ##### User Mobility
		- The presentation emphasizes the importance of designing applicationsthat require minimal movement from users. It recommends usingsystem-level recentering methods to adjust the app’s view when a usermoves.
		- ##### Space Utilization
		- The importance of optimizing an app’s usage of space is discussed, asthe available physical space for users can vary. It advises againstconstraining your app based on the physical space available and insteadcreating an app that can function in any amount of space.
		- ##### Dimensionality
		- The use of depth and scale in designing the user experience isemphasized. Depth can help with hierarchy and focus, and scale can beused to emphasize content. The text warns against overusing depth,especially with text, and encourages developers to experiment with scaleto achieve the desired user experience.
		- ##### Immersiveness
		- The passage introduces the concept of an immersion spectrum, where anapp can transition between various states of immersion based on theuser’s experience. The importance of smooth transitions, designing withconsideration to user focus, thoughtful blending with reality, andkeeping the user comfortable are emphasized.
		- ##### Sound Design
		- It also highlights the importance of using spatial audio to enhance theimmersive experience of an app, which includes attaching sound toobjects and creating soundscapes.
		- ##### User Comfort
		- Recommendations for moving an immersive app, focusing on avoidingdisorienting fast movements and instead recommending fade out and fadein techniques to keep the user comfortable during motion.
		- ##### Transitions
		- It highlights the importance of clear, intuitive methods for enteringand exiting immersive experiences. It suggests using easily recognizablesymbols, such as arrows for expanding or collapsing views.
		- ##### Authenticity
		- Emphasizes creating an authentic experience that takes full advantage ofthe platform’s capabilities. An example given is Freeform, which uses alarge creative space allowing users to view all their content at once.
		- ##### Key Moments
		- Focusing on a “key moment” that provides a unique spatial or immersiveexperience is recommended. This could involve enhancing a moment withdepth and scale or transforming the user’s space to create a unique andmemorable experience.

- # Brain
	- Apple has submitted a patent application that raises some serious privacy and ethical concerns.
	- [From this post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196781454519877632/)
	- ![1715807554519.jpeg](../assets/1715807554519_1716117593773_0.jpeg)
	- The US Patent and Trademark Office lists application 2023/0225659 as a “biosensing device” built into Apple’s earbuds to measure “biological signal parameters from a user.”
		- 👉 Electroencephalography (EEG). In other words, the aim is to directly record the user’s brain waves from tiny sensors positioned within the ear canal.
		- 👉 Electromyography (EMG). This records muscle movements and the information can be used to help understand facial expressions and jaw movements related to emotion.
		- 👉 Electrooculography (EOG) tracks eye movements, particularly side-to-side.
		- 👉 Electrocardiogram (ECG) typically measures the electrical activity of the heart.
		- 👉 Galvanic skin response (GSR), which provides an indirect measure of emotional arousal – that is, the strength of an emotional response.
		- 👉 Blood volume pulse (BVP). This is measured using photoplethysmography and provides information about heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV).
	- In other words, the aim is to collect a very comprehensive set of neurological and biometric data from the user. Creepy, right?!
	- It’s unclear to me how you could even record meaningful data from within the ear.
	- If this kind of interface goes ahead it should be
		- 1. Voluntary. Participants should not be forced or deceived into providing physiological or neurological data. Volunteers at liberty to stop at any time.
		- 2. Limited. Personal data may only be collected for a specific, explicit and legitimate purpose. This purpose must be clearly stated, and only stored as long as needed to complete that purpose.
		- 3. Transparent. Requires informed consent including being aware the data are being collected and knowing the risks involved, including whether the information will be shared with other organizations.
		- 4. Autonomy. Free from manipulation. Participants should not be forced or deceived into making decisions they would not otherwise make.
		- 5. Valid. Must be based on valid science and led by scientifically trained staff.
	- To my mind, this application potentially violates 4 out of 5 of these principles (I don’t see any evidence of manipulation) and this makes me deeply uneasy!
