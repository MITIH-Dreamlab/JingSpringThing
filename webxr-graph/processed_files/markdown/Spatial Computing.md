- **Definition**
	- Simon Greenwold defined spatial computing in 2003 as human interaction with machines that manipulate referents to real objects.
	- In simpler terms, it refers to humans interacting with digital 3D data referencing the real world.
- **Spatial Computing Industry**
	- Spatial computing is a fast-growing industry, particularly in business-to-business (B2B) products and services.
	- It is set to merge with other technologies like AI, robotics, and augmented reality, leading to innovative products.
- **Infrastructure and Investment**
	- Infrastructure for spatial computing applications is becoming more affordable and accessible. (5G etc)
	- Many entrepreneurs, technology executives, and investors are focusing on hardware, software, and infrastructure for spatial computing.
- **Examples of Spatial Computing**
	- Video games like FIFA and Wii Sports where players interact with virtual environments.
	- Movies and TV shows with visual effects like Avatar, requiring 3D scene and character building.
	- Use of augmented reality filters in social media and 3D face scanning in transportation.
- **Impact and Proliferation**
	- Humans are optimised by evolution for 3D experiences, which makes spatial computing appealing, but the hardware is "in the way"
	- The evolution of technology like GPUs, cloud computing, and AI chips has enabled the proliferation of spatial computing.
- **Spatial Computing in Various Sectors**
	- Used in musculoskeletal healthcare, architectural visualisation, industrial robots, and mapping for navigation.
	- Combining with other technologies to increase fidelity and sophistication.
- **Future of Spatial Computing**
	- Machine-machine (M2M) spatial computing is likely to surpass human-machine (H2M) interactions.
