	- **Plenoptic Function and Light Fields (1908 & 1936):**
		- Gabriel Lippmann introduces the concept of the **plenoptic function** which evolves into the **light field** concept, simplifying the capture and representation of light as it travels through space.
	- **Advances in Computing and Graphics (1960-1980s):**
		- The development of lasers, holograms, and computer graphics sets the stage for more advanced 3D representations and the capture of light fields.
	- **Lightfield Camera Arrays and Image-Based Rendering (2000):**
		- The introduction of lightfield camera arrays and image-based rendering techniques brings light fields into practical use, although it remains complex and niche.

- The paper [Zip-NeRF](https://jonbarron.info/zipnerf/): Anti-Aliased Grid-Based Neural Radiance Fields" proposes a technique that combines ideas from rendering and signal processing to combat aliasing in grid-based representations of neural radiance fields (NeRF). NeRF's learned mapping from spatial coordinates to colors and volumetric density can be accelerated through the use of grid-based representations, but they lack an explicit understanding of scale and often introduce aliasing. The proposed technique combines mip-NeRF 360 and Instant NGP to yield error rates that are 8%-77% lower than either prior technique and trains 24x faster than mip-NeRF 360. The technique uses multisampling to approximate the average NGP feature over a conical frustum, and the method produces prefiltered renderings that do not flicker or shimmer, even as the camera moves laterally. Moreover, their improvements to proposal network supervision result in a prefiltered proposal output that preserves the foreground object for all frames, preventing an artifact called z-aliasing where foreground content alternately appears and disappears as the camera moves towards or away from the scene content. The proposed method shows promising results for accelerating NeRF training while combating aliasing in grid-based representations.
