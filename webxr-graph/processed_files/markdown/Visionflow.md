	- ## **Project Details**:
		- Partners: SM Robotics Ltd (Lead), Flossverse Ltd.
		- Competition: Feasibility studies for AI solutions.
		- Application Name: VisionFlow.
		- Duration: 5 months, starting 11 September 2023.
		- Research Category: Feasibility studies.
		- Summary: VisionFlow aims to develop pre-visualization workflows integrating machine learning and robot control software for virtual production.
	- ## **Project Summary and Public Description**:
		- VisionFlow will develop innovative workflows for the virtual production industry.
		- It inverts existing workflows, focusing on scene-driven camera motion.
		- Key features include the use of open-source AI and a simpler interface for non-artists to create 3D environments.
		- The project will build upon the open-source Flossverse telecollaboration stack.
	- ## **InnovateUK Feedback**:
		- Aligns with the competition's focus on integrating machine learning in video production.
		- Assessor Feedback: Generally considered in scope, but involvement of a video production company could strengthen alignment.
	- ## **Need or Challenge**:
		- The project addresses the reluctance in the film industry to adopt AI and ML technologies due to tight margins and complexity.
		- VisionFlow introduces "parallax plates as a service", integrating robotics with ML-based video generation.
		- Key benefits include increased productivity in pre-visualization and improved collaboration.
		- Assessor Feedback: Positive recognition of the project's potential to improve productivity in video content production. However, a closer association with a video production company could enhance the application's relevance and impact.
	- ## **Approach and Innovation**:
		- VisionFlow will integrate AI-generated video with robotics for innovative virtual production.
		- Plans to develop new tele-collaboration technologies for virtual production.
		- Focus on disrupting traditional workflows with more efficient solutions.
		- Assessor Feedback: The approach is plausible but lacks detailed deliverables and milestones for monitoring progress. A more comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape is suggested.
	- ## **Team and Resources**:
		- Dr. Sean Chase Mandrake Hill and Dr. John O'Hare lead the project with significant expertise in robotics and tele-collaboration.
		- Potential collaborations with G6Moco and Pathway XR Innovation Lab.
		- Assessor Feedback: The team is well-qualified but would benefit from direct involvement with a video production company.
	- ## **Market Awareness**:
		- The project targets the rapidly growing virtual production market.
		- Potential for significant savings in both small and large-scale virtual production facilities.
		- Assessor Feedback: Good market understanding but requires further research on barriers to entry and secondary markets.
	- ## **Outcomes and Route to Market**:
		- Focuses on demonstrating cost savings and efficiency in virtual production.
		- Plans to engage with early adopters and expand to global markets.
		- Assessor Feedback: Credible route to market but needs more detailed financial projections and dissemination plans.
	- ## **Wider Impacts**:
		- **Economic Benefits**:
	 - Potential savings for virtual production facilities, reducing costs.
	 - End-users benefit from reduced production costs.
	 - Drives innovation in virtual production, encouraging market growth.
	 - Contributes to UK's economic growth by attracting investments and creating jobs.
		- **Impact on Government Priorities**:
	 - Supports government focus on creative industries and digital technologies.
		- **Environmental Impacts**:
	 - Positive: Reduces film industry's ecological footprint.
	 - Negative: Potential increase in energy consumption due to digital technologies.
		- **Regional Impacts and Job Creation**:
	 - Supports regional virtual production hubs in the UK.
	 - Encourages job creation and fosters creative communities.
		- **Diversity and Social Inclusion**:
	 - Democratizes access to virtual production tools, promoting diversity in film and media.
		- **Health, Safety, and Quality of Life**:
	 - Improves safety in film production by reducing on-location shoot risks.
	- ## **Risks**:
		- ### *Technical Risks*:
	 - Integration challenges, limitations of AI, compatibility issues.
		- ### **Commercial Risks**:
	 - Market adoption uncertainty, competition, monetization challenges.
		- ### **Managerial Risks**:
	 - Collaboration efficiency, scope and timeline management, expertise recruitment.
		- ### **Legal Risks**:
	 - Data protection and AI risk analysis.
		- ### **Mitigation Strategies**:
	 - Dedicate resources for testing and refining, focus on achievable goals, conduct market analysis, establish clear communication, and management practices.
