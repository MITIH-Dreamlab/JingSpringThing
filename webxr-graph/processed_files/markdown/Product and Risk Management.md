	- Scientific inquiry maps to product management. **Central Role of [[Product Design]] Managers**: Deciding what to do next.
	- | **Scientific Method** | **Lean Product Development** | **General Product Development** |
	  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
	  | Observe | Build | Where do we want to go (Vision) |
	  | Hypothesise | Measure | Where are we now (Data/Analysis) |
	  | Test | Learn | Where should we go next (Strategy) |
	- ### Risk: [[Politics, Law, Privacy]]
		- When I started my formal postgraduate machine learning training risks were couched in biases, now this is [[Safety and alignment]], with the UK positioning itself as a global leader. This likely does have impact on your business goals.
			- #### Mitigate GenAI risks through product management. Maybe don't just be grabby for AI.
		- **Question 1: Where Do We Want to Go?**
			- **Vision and Goal Setting**: Defining a clear destination or North Star.
				- My northstar (as an example) is
				- ```Equity of opportunity of access to AI, to support a fairer world. ```
			- **Where Are We Coming From?
		- Product market analysis** :  In your business this is more likely to be a function of your product methodolgy
			- I am coming from a position of understanding collaboration in groups, across technology, 
			  **where some members of the group are likely to be AI.**
			- **Where Should We Go Next?**
		- **Strategic Planning**: Deciding the next steps based on vision and current status.
			- For me, this mean helping build B2B capabilities,
			- Education, and interweaving of people and AI through storytelling,
			- Distributed, global, AI enabled infrastructure,
			- Clearly communicating why,
			- Building communities to help.
	- This won't be you and your company, but this is a great time to work out these checklists.
		- **SWOT Analysis**: Evaluating strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
		- I am trying to build **this** bit of the business journey through these presentations

		- But my alarm bells go off when I see:
			- ? A crowded landscape
			- ? FOMO driven decision making
			- ? Sky high valuations for an early space
		- If you took the word "AI" out, is the product still solving a customer problem?
		- AI is a solution, not a problem. Ask yourself:
			- What is the pain point?
			- How many users share this pain?
			- Is the pain big enough to take action?
			- Is the pain underserved by non-AI tools?
			- How accurate does the solution need to be?
		- Plot the problem on a fluency vs. accuracy grid.
			- Gen AI today is great for high fluency + low accuracy problems (e.g., productivity).
			- It's not great for solutions that need high accuracy (e.g., financial decisions).
		- How fast will incumbents move?
			- Incumbents like Microsoft, Google, and Adobe have moved incredibly fast on AI.
			- Startups that overlap with core incumbent use cases might struggle.
		- AI presentation startups need to be MUCH better than AI in Powerpoint to thrive.
			- Is there a moat? Examples moats include:
		- Access to proprietary data and models
			- Exclusive contracts with large customers
			- Great product even without AI
			- Exceptional talent in the selected field
			- Business models that incumbents avoid
			- And of course...speed of execution.
		- Is it overvalued?
			- If an AI product already has $100M+ valuation, you should think:
			- Can it continue to grow and (more importantly) retain users?
			- In a crowded space like AI copywriting and productivity
		- that could get hard.
		- To recap, here are 5 questions to ask to evaluate AI products and companies:
			- 1. Without "AI", is it still solving a problem?
			  2. How accurate does the solution need to be?
			  3. How fast will incumbents move?
			  4. Is there a moat?
			  5. Is it overvalued?
			  7/ I hope these questions also help builders who are thinking of creating new AI products.
