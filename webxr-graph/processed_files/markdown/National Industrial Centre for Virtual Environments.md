	- This was from our first paper, published by [Ruth Aylett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAACrVwB204Ab7f4c5tb6XmlXPpd9ov_mrA), which we did as the project at the end of the masters programme. Every single triangle in that was hand drawn seperately, one at a time, by me. Modelling wasn't really a proper thing back then. It was CAD, or Medit on an SGI O2. You can see the resemblance to N64 games of the era which were all the same hardware/software pipelines.

	- [Dr Simon Campion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAfPu4gBKe76g1PvTLMvi7uMUwf9ZAMC60s) using our experimental Barco based immersion workbench. Again a mockup, but about right. We took this to Farnborough airshow in support of [Euravia Engineering & Supply Co. Limited](https://www.linkedin.com/company/euravia/)

	- The NICVE 4 sided system, which was powered by a three rack SGI Onyx2 IR2 "supercomputer". It was made of wood because the tracking systems was electromagnetic (flock of birds). When trains went past everything wobbled a bit. I used to sit in the dark reconverging the CRT guns every week with music blaring. It was a good task.

	- One of the SGI cabs being delivered. Must be 1997 then? They were brand new. That was expensive. Really really expensive. We ran the whole building off them.

	- This was our reality room, with 3 edge blended Barco projectors. They were RGB CRT guns. Pre digital. Wow. This is a mockup because there wasn't enough light for cameras of the time to capture the glory. That's a laser scan of a 747 by Mensi, who sold us a laser scanner for a couple of hundred thousand pounds that took a couple of samples a second.

	- This was the Trimension Relocatable Reality Centre, at GMEX in Manchester in this case, and a very young me. The compute on the left is an SGI Onyx2 Deskside.

	- ### Adrenaline Rush
	- I was a member of the science team on the first ever jump of DaVinci's parachute design, for an IMAX film called [Adrenaline rush, The science of risk (2002) Video
