- ## Llama 3 overview
	- Meta (formerly Facebook) has recently released LLaMA-3,  a series of foundational large language models (LLMs) that aim to advance AI research while remaining more accessible in terms of computational requirements.
	- ### Performance
		- LLaMA-3 models demonstrate competitive performance on various language modeling tasks, showcasing significant improvements over previous open weights models.
		- Integrated free across their social media platforms
		- Fast image generation, can be fine tunes for creatives.

	- ### Efficiency
		- LLaMA-3 models are notably smaller than comparable LLMs. They were more efficient to train.
		- Sizes are currently:
			- 7B parameters, outperforming the previous 70B models on some metrics
			- 70B parameters, approaching or exceeding some closed source online models
			- 400B parameters (still in training), expected to outperform SOTA models
		- This efficiency allows them to run on less powerful hardware, broadening accessibility for researchers.
			- They can be fine tuned more easily.
	- ### Bias and Safety
		- Meta has taken active steps to assess and mitigate potential biases and harmful outputs. This is usually "undone" by the community at some stage for performance gains, raising important questions.
	- ### Open-Source Focus
		- Meta's release of the LLaMA-3 weights and code under a non-commercial license fosters transparency and encourages research collaboration.

- ## Acceptable Use Policy
	- **Open Source Controversy**
		- Llama 3 is claimed to be open source but faces criticisms.
		- Licence restrictions may not meet the [[open source]] Initiative's definition.
		- Restrictions on free use, modification, and redistribution.
	- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**
		- Applicable to Llama 2, but also underpins Llama 3 license.
		- Prohibits:
			- Law violations.
			- Infringement of third-party rights.
			- Misuse of sensitive information.
		- Emphasizes compliance across jurisdictions.
		- Lacks specifics on consequences for policy violations.
	- **Intellectual Property Rights**
		- Grants non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, royalty-free license.
		- Users can utilize and modify Llama Materials under conditions.
		- Meta retains ownership of foundational technology and Llama Materials.
		- Licensees own derivative works but with commercial use restrictions.
	- **Legal Implications**
		- Termination of license if licensee sues Meta for IP infringement.
		- Mandatory indemnification of Meta against third-party claims related to user's use of Llama.
	- **License and AUP Dynamics**
		- Unilateral updates to AUP by Meta.
		- Compliance with extensive laws and regulations required.
		- Significant operational constraints implied.
		- Liability limitations and warranty disclaimers shift risk to users.
