  Epic games flywheel by Matthew Ball
- Epic is a behemoth and has made better business development decisions,and have a better technology than their main competitor Unity3D. Unitydidn’t make the cut for this book, though their technology is great.Their recent merger with a [malwaremanufacturer](https://www.pcgamer.com/unity-is-merging-with-a-company-who-made-a-malware-installer/)and a history of poor data privacy have removed them from considerationat this time.
- ICVFX (in camera virtual effects) or “Volume shooting” is theapplication of large, bright LED walls to film and TV production. Morebroadly than this Virtual Production is a suite of real-timetechnologies that weaves through pre and post production to acceleratecreativity, and reduce costs. These are collaborative, and oftendistributed tasks:
-
	- Set ideation and design
-
	- Dry runs with actors to plan shots in mixed reality
-
	- Virtual set design and storyboarding in full VR
-
	- Lighting design
-
	- Shot camera track design (movement, focus, lens choices etc)
