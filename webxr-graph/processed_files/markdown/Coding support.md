- The text discusses the concerns around using AI to generate code, specifically around the idea of proofreading the code. The author describes an experience with using voice-to-text where they found it difficult to proofread the text for errors. The text argues that using AI to generate code changes the work from writing code to proofreading code, and that this is a problem.

- AI code auto-completion tools like [[Microsoft CoPilot]] have shown the potential for AI to enhance software development. The latest [[Microsoft CoPilot]] leverages [[ChatGPT]] 4 and is extremely good.
- AI will likely be incorporated into most software products going forward to enhance capabilities and engagement. Some experiences are better suited to standalone interfaces rather than cramming functionality into chatbots.
- Effective use of AI tools requires developing specialized skills around prompting, understanding system capabilities and limitations, and framing problems appropriately. Different AI systems have strengths in different domains.
- Software development will transition towards more hybrid human-AI teams, with less focus on writing code line-by-line. AI can provide significant productivity gains by automating rote tasks.
- There are open questions around whether to expose functionality through general chatbot interfaces vs company-specific products. There are strategic and technical considerations favouring bespoke solutions.
- Open source software tends to improve quickly over time and should not be underestimated. However, regulations could potentially suppress open source AI progress.
