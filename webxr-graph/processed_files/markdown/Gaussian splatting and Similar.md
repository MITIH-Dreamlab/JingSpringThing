- # NeRFs
	- MobileNeRF: This approach adapts NeRFs for mobile devices by exploiting the polygon rasterization pipeline for efficient neural field rendering. It achieves very fast rendering times (0.016-0.017s) but requires long training times[](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-graphics-neural-rendering).
	- MobileR2L: This method uses a full CNN-based neural light field model with a super-resolution model in its second stage. It achieves real-time inference on mobile devices while maintaining high image quality, rendering a 1008x756 image of real 3D scenes in 18.04ms on an iPhone 13[](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-graphics-neural-rendering).
	- Instant NGP (Neural Graphics Primitives): Developed by NVIDIA, this technique significantly speeds up the training and rendering of NeRFs, allowing for near-instantaneous scene reconstruction[](https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-neural-rendering/blob/master/docs/INTRODUCTION-AND-SURVEY.md).
	- Plenoxels (Plenoptic Voxels): This method replaces neural networks with a sparse 3D grid of spherical harmonics, enabling faster training and competitive quality compared to NeRFs[](https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-neural-rendering/blob/master/docs/INTRODUCTION-AND-SURVEY.md).
	- NGLOD (Neural Geometric Level of Detail): This approach combines neural implicit representations with explicit geometric representations, allowing for multi-resolution rendering and faster training[](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00028).
	- NeRF-MAE (Masked AutoEncoders for NeRFs): This technique applies the concept of masked autoencoders to NeRFs for self-supervised 3D representation learning, potentially improving generalization and efficiency[](https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/research/neural-rendering/).
