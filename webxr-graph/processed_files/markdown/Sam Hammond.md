	- ### Author Background: Sam Hammond
		- **Background:** Senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation with previous tenures at the Niskanen Institute and Mercatus Center. His expertise is in the intersection of policy and transformative technologies, particularly AI, and how they shape economic and societal structures. Be warned he has strong libertarian leanings and this does colour his thinking.
		- **Contributions:** Hammond's work involves deep dives into how evolving technologies necessitate changes in government and societal frameworks, looking beyond immediate implications to long-term structural shifts. I am fascinated by this so I have added his work into my knowledge graph here.
		- **Future Predictions:** Discusses the looming possibility of AI systems emulating complex human tasks, leading to potential societal and economic upheavals as they integrate deeper into various sectors. This is the concept of the "drop in replacement" for humans in the loop.
	- ## AI Safety and Concerns
		- ### Ethical Considerations
	 - **Bias and Discrimination:** Discusses how AI can inherit and amplify human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, law enforcement, and lending. Explores the ethical implications and the need for fair and transparent algorithms. He's more cautious about opensource AI than I am.
	 - **First-Order Effects:** Details the direct impacts of AI, such as job displacement and privacy concerns, emphasizing the immediate ethical and societal challenges they present.
	 - **Second-Order Effects:** Societal and institutional changes. Explores how AI's integration into every facet of life might alter human relationships, governance, and cultural values. Discusses the potential for AI to reshape societal hierarchies, influence global power dynamics, and challenge our notions of autonomy and agency.
		- ### Mastering AI for Safety
	 - **Accelerating Defensive AI:** Discusses the need to develop defensive AI modalities to counteract malicious use and unintended consequences. Explores strategies for safe AI deployment and the importance of international collaboration on AI safety standards.
	 - **Ethical Frameworks:** Emphasizes the importance of establishing robust ethical frameworks and guidelines for AI development and use, considering diverse perspectives and the need for adaptability as AI technologies evolve.
	 - **Government Involvement:** This may be the best path forward. Once companies like OpenAI or Anthropic reach the tipping point of superintelligence it makes sense to work closely with national governments. This is already happening in Gulf States with projects like Falcon. This is the "gain of function" moment for AI where the dangers become acute enough to compartmentalise.
	- ## Three Possible Futures id:: 65929cb3-95b4-454b-8c9e-7ae231aec377
		- ### AI Leviathan
	 - **State Surveillance and Control:** Explores the potential for states to extend their surveillance capabilities and tighten control over citizens using advanced AI, leading to an Orwellian future where privacy is virtually nonexistent.
	 - **Implications for Democracy:** Discusses the challenges this scenario poses to democratic norms and individual freedoms, with a focus on the trade-offs between security and liberty.
		- ### Techno-Feudalism
	 - **Fragmented Society:** Describes a future where societal fragmentation occurs due to the rise of powerful AI platforms that take over traditional state roles. Envisions a world where loyalty shifts from states to platform-centric communities.
	 - **Private Governance:** Explores the potential trajectory of AI leading to a future where traditional state functions are increasingly replaced or supplemented by private, AI-driven platforms. This rise of corporate entities or conglomerates that provide governance, security, and social services, side-lining traditional state functions and leading to a complex web of interdependencies and power dynamics. This shift in societal organisation resembles medieval structures, and he terms it 'techno-feudalism'. I had been calling this the fracturing of society in my writing, but I might start to adopt this phase.
	 - **Implications for Society:** Discusses how the decentralization of authority and the rise of powerful private entities could shape societal norms, governance, and daily life, leading to a redefinition of citizenship, rights, and [[Social contract and jobs]]. He identifies Uber as a social credit system which we blithely accept. Over time this trends to separation like that seen in the insurance markets, where "all the 1 star Uber drivers drive the 1 star passenger", but writ large across society. This is also "gated communities" and the micro-states defended by AI as posited by authors like Neal Stephenson in Diamond Age.
	 - **Adversarial Renaissance:** This might well be dystopian, but equally it could be a renaissance moment, with national governments losing their hegemonic control to exascale compute powered conglomerates, city states, micro countries etc. This is for sure more adversarial, but not **necessarily** bad. This is a libertarian viewpoint, but also perhaps a classic liberal one.
