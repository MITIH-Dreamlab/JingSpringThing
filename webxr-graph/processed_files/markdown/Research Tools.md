	- ## Elicit's Approach and Features
		- ### AI Research Assistant
		- Elicit is an AI research assistant that aims to make high quality reasoning abundant
		- Currently focused on text-based workflows, especially literature summarization and helping users understand what is known on a topic based on existing research
		- Long-term goal is to go further into reasoning and decision making
		- ### Systematic Review Automation
		- Elicit's workflow is inspired by the systematic review or meta-analysis process used to summarize scientific literature
		- Aims to automate this laborious process which typically involves teams of people working for over a year to find relevant papers, extract data, and summarize findings
		- Makes this capability more accessible for any research question
		- ### Key Features
		- Enter a research question and get back relevant papers along with AI-generated summaries of each paper with respect to the query
		- Extract structured data from papers into tabular format (e.g. population studied, methods used, interventions, outcomes)
		- Provide a description or instructions for data to extract, allowing custom extraction
		- Group or pivot extracted data by arguments, effects, interventions, techniques rather than just by paper
		- Notebook interface allows users to interactively search for papers, extract data, analyze results, and share templates of analysis with others
		- ### Approach to Building Elicit
		- Extensive testing of language model capabilities and designing human evaluation processes before powerful models were available
		- Breaking down complex reasoning tasks into granular steps that language models can be trained on and evaluated against
		- Intentionally not just training a model on a large dataset, but defining ideal step-by-step processes an expert would follow
		- Enables easier evaluation, troubleshooting and transparency into model's reasoning process
		- **Eliminated credits entirely**
		-
		- **Find Papers, Summaries, and Chat are now unlimited**Â on your Elicit Basic plan moving forward
		- Weâ€™ve introduced improvements to Elicit Plus and added a new Pro plan for professional researchers doing systematic reviews.
		- **Elicit Basic is still completely free to use.**Â With these changes, you can now use Elicit Basic indefinitely, until youâ€™re ready to upgrade to Elicit Plus or Elicit Pro.

	- To bring the content up to date in UK English as a short, well-formatted summary, we need to integrate the provided web links into the summary. Hereâ€™s a concise overview based on the key points from each source:
- ### Writing a Plain Language Summary of Research Findings
   
   Writing a plain language summary of research findings is crucial for making health and social care research accessible to the general public, health professionals, and policymakers. The Health Research Authority (HRA) emphasizes the importance of transparency by requiring research sponsors to include a plain language summary in their final reports, which are then published on the HRA website alongside the study research summaries.
   
   Key principles for writing a good plain language summary include:
	- **Accuracy, clarity, and conciseness**
	- **Avoiding prior knowledge assumptions**
	- **Using appropriate language**
	- **Short sentences (up to 20 words) and paragraphs (up to 3 sentences)**
	- **Neutral language**
	- **Considering infographics with explanatory text**
	- **Involving patients, patient representatives, or members of the public in the development and/or review of the summary**
- ### Content to Include in a Lay Summary
   
   A lay summary should include:
	- **Thank you to study participants**
	- **General information about the research:**
		- Study title
		- Who carried out the research (including sponsor, funding, and competing interests)
		- Public involvement in the study (number of participants, their relevant lived experience, and their roles)
		- Where and when the study took place
		- Why the research was needed
		- Main questions studied
	- **Details of participants, treatments, and medical problems**
	- **Results of the study and its impact on patients and researchers**
	- **Details of any further research planned**
	- **Where to learn more about the study**
	  
	  For further guidance, refer to:
	- **National Institute for Health Research (NIHR): Plain English Summaries Guidance**
	- **Digital Curation Centre (DCC): How to Write a Lay Summary**
	- **HRA Public Involvement Guidance**
- ### Preventing Errors in Security Content Updates
   
   CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company, experienced an issue with a Rapid Response Content update containing an undetected error. To prevent such errors, CrowdStrike has implemented several measures:
	- **Improved testing:** Local developer testing, content update and rollback testing, stress testing, fuzzing, and fault injection.
	- **Enhanced validation checks:** Adding additional validation checks to the Content Validator to guard against problematic content.
	- **Error handling:** Enhancing existing error handling in the Content Interpreter.
	- **Staggered deployment:** Implementing a staggered deployment strategy for Rapid Response Content updates.
	- **Monitoring and feedback:** Improving monitoring for sensor and system performance, collecting feedback during deployment to guide a phased rollout.
	- **Customer control:** Providing customers with greater control over the delivery of Rapid Response Content updates.
	- **Third-party validation:** Conducting multiple independent third-party security code reviews and end-to-end quality process reviews.
- ### Digital News Report
   
   The 2024 Digital News Report highlights the challenges of news fatigue and avoidance. To address these issues, news organizations are adopting a user needs model, which includes:
	- **Staying up to date**
	- **Learning more**
	- **Gaining varied perspectives**
	  
	  Audiences prefer news that provides context and wider perspectives, making the news more accessible and engaging. The report also notes that younger audiences are more interested in stories that inspire, connect, and entertain, while older audiences prioritize local and international news, as well as political news.
- ### Cambridge IGCSE English
   
   Cambridge IGCSE First Language English is designed for learners whose first language is English. The course aims to develop learners' analysis and communication skills, including inference and presenting opinions effectively. The syllabus encourages learners to read widely for enjoyment and to further their awareness of English usage. Cambridge IGCSE English also provides teaching and learning resources for teachers, including schemes of work, example candidate responses, past papers, and digital resources.
- ### Summarizing Web Pages with Google Assistant
   
   Google Assistant can summarize web pages using Generative AI. However, this service is currently only available on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices in English, and it cannot summarize paywalled articles or content less than 200 words. Users can provide feedback on summaries, which helps improve the service. The Assistant Summarize feature filters out sensitive information like pornography, violence, and hate speech. #[[ðŸ¤–]]
