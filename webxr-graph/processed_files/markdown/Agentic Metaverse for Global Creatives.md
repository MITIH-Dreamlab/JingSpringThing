- # Introduction and Problem Definition
- [[Delivery Planning]]
	- ## Overview of the Metaverse and Digital Society:
		- The concept of [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] has gained significant attention, with various stakeholders positioning themselves to capitalize on its potential. While it remains unclear exactly what form the Metaverse will take or whether people truly desire it, it is evident that digital society holds considerable promise. We see advantage less in social metaverse, and more in solving business to business technical use cases where professionals with visual technical problems, or training requirements, gather in collaborative spaces.
		- We have designed an [[Metaverse Ontology]] to ensure specificity for our work.
	- ## Trust, Accessibility, Governance, and Safeguarding:
		- The Metaverse faces numerous challenges, including poor adoption rates, overstated market need, and a lack of genuine digital society use cases. Meanwhile [[Trust and Safety]] abuses by incumbent providers have led to potential inflection points in the organization of the wider internet. Moreover, emerging markets and less developed nations face barriers to entry due to inadequate identification, banking infrastructure, and computing power. There is an opportunity to build pervasive digital spaces with a different and more open foundation, learning from these lessons.
	- ## The Need for Modular Open-Source Solutions:
		- Developing a topologically flat, inclusive, permissionless, federated, and [[open source]] Metaverse is essential to address these challenges. By using open-source AI tooling and large language models, it is possible to improve creativity, safeguarding, and governance, while breaking down language barriers and accessibility challenges. Implementing secure, trusted, and task-appropriate solutions can promote collaboration and innovation across various industries.
	- ## Technical Problem Definition:
		- The specific technical challenges and opportunities the proposed framework addresses include:
		- Evergreen telecollaboration around technical issues
		- Exchange of goods, services, and money within systems, without friction
		- Identity management within virtual spaces
		- Access to information in the extrinsic world from within the tool
		- Federation of instances without overhead (scaling)
		- Seamless access to personal information within and without the collaborative system
		- Ability to take advantage of supporting smart support agents (bots, etc.) throughout
		- Governance, trust, and safeguarding
	- ## Lean Canvas Business Model:
		- Problem: Existing large-scale telecollaboration solutions suffer from poor adoption, limited accessibility, and trust issues. Meanwhile, emerging markets struggle to participate in the growing digital society due to the lack of inclusive tools and infrastructure, limiting access to global talent and new pools of ideas. There is insufficient provision of global talent pipelines for highly technical workflows.
		- Solution: Develop a secure, accessible, and inclusive platform for specialized telecollaboration spaces that seamlessly integrate advanced AI, ML, highly scalable and proven distributed systems, and open-source principles to create a digital society that caters to diverse industries, users globally, and captures global talent and innovative ideas.
		- Value Proposition: Ultra low cost training spaces, accessible 24/7 through very low end hardware. Interact with highly customizable, task-appropriate, and user-friendly specialized telecollaboration spaces supported by specially trained and optimised supportive large language AI models. Multi-lingual for emerging markets, enabling access to untapped global talent and fostering the exchange of diverse ideas.
		- Customer Segments: Initially Universities, but this will scale to be sector specific, catering to the global training, research, biomedical, and creative industries, with a special focus on empowering users in emerging markets such as Africa and India, and connecting them with worldwide opportunities and resources.
		- Revenue Streams: Tiered subscription plans to accommodate various user needs and budgets, as well as tailored enterprise solutions for large-scale clients. Bespoke consulting and support trending toward software as a service at scale.
		- Key Metrics: Track user growth, engagement, and retention, successful collaborations across industries, the platform's positive impact on users in emerging markets, and the effectiveness of global talent capture and idea exchange.
		- Unfair Advantage: The team's extensive experience in telecollaboration research, AI, ML, and a deep understanding of the complex landscape of emerging technologies, including highly scalable and proven distributed systems, provide a unique edge in creating a game-changing platform for specialized telecollaboration spaces that are secure, trusted, and tailored to diverse user needs while enabling access to global talent and innovative ideas.
- # Proposed Layered Framework
	- ## Layer 1: Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr Protocols:
		- The proposed framework leverages [[Bitcoin]] , [[Lightning and Similar L2]] , and [[nostr]] protocols to provide a secure and decentralized foundation for value exchange, identity management, and communication. These technologies enable the transfer of portable 'goods' across digital society and promote the development and adoption of open protocols and data formats. The Nostr protocol, in particular, can link and federate mixed reality spaces, providing identity assurances and mediating data synchronization while maintaining reasonably strong cryptography. This also allows integration with the legacy web through ubiquitous web sockets. Bitcoin and associated technologies, despite their issues, have the potential to revolutionize the way digital society operates by enabling "money-like networks" which are a cornerstone of human interaction. Representations of traditional currencies can ride securely on top of these networks as stablecoins, opening up global collaborative working practices, especially for emerging markets. Streaming micropayments and machine to machine (AI to AI) interactions are crucially and under-considered in this context.
	- ### Layer 2: Modular Human-Computer Interface:
		- The framework proposes the development of collaborative global networks for training, research, biomedical, and creative industries using immersive and accessible environments. Engaging with ideas from diverse cultural backgrounds can enrich the overall user experience. Industry players have noted the risk and failures associated with closed systems like Meta and are embracing the "open Metaverse" narrative to de-risk their interests. To enable a truly open and interoperable Metaverse, it is crucial to develop open-source APIs, SDKs, and data standards that allow different platforms to communicate and exchange information. While the initial focus will be on building around a simpler open-source engine, the framework aims to link across standards such as Unity, [[Unreal]], and [[NVIDIA Omniverse]] as it develops. This can be accomplished using the federation layer.
	- ### LLM and Generative ML Integration:
		- ### Bots and AI Agents:
			- Autonomous AI [[Agents]], bonded to, but not bounded by, each federated mixed reality instance, can be self-governing entities that operate within their federated virtual social spaces, drawing upon private Bitcoin and Lightning wallets to perform and mediate economic exchanges within the spaces. They could also trivially operate outside the virtual space, and within other spaces on the same metaverse federation. They would accomplish this by drawing on their 'home' GPU/TPU processors where appropriate, or else using distributed large language model (LLM) processing to accomplish tasks assigned by their instructors. They can interact with the 'web2' world using open-source software called auto-gpt and have constraints, such as "time to live" and limited access to funds through their Bitcoin Lightning wallets.
		- ### Resource Management and Financial Autonomy:
			- These AI agents have access to dedicated LLM resources within their home instances in the federated virtual social spaces. If such resources are unavailable, they can resort to using slower, distributed open-source LLMs like Horde. This flexibility ensures that the agents can continue to function and complete tasks even if faced with limited LLM interpretive resources. The AI agents have their own private Bitcoin and Lightning wallets, which enable them to manage and utilize funds independently. They can use these funds to pay for services, acquire resources, or even trade with other agents or users within the virtual social spaces.
		- ### Social Interactions and Adaptive Learning:
			- Within the federated virtual social spaces, AI agents can communicate and collaborate with other agents or human users. They can participate in discussions, provide assistance, or even learn from the interactions, thereby improving their capabilities over time. Language translation, governance, and safeguarding could also be developed. Safeguarding would be handled by threshold risk triggers and transmission of data in a sovereign way to all parties, allowing external action by authorities appropriate to any abuse. As AI agents interact with their environment, other agents, and users, they can learn and adapt their behaviour. This enables them to improve their performance, better understand their assigned tasks, and become more effective at achieving their goals.
	- # Application Case Studies
		- ## Classic Use Cases:
			- The proposed framework can be applied to traditional collaborative scenarios, such as small teams working on product, architectural, or industrial design. These teams can benefit from CVEs (collaborative virtual environments) that allow them to visualize, modify, and iterate on 3D models in real-time.
- ## Expanding Use Cases with AI and ML:
	- ### Virtual Training and Simulation:
		- CVEs can facilitate skill development and training in various industries, such as healthcare, military, aviation, and emergency response. Trainees can practice procedures in a virtual environment, with natural language AI providing instructions, explanations, or feedback, and visual generative ML potentially customizing scenarios to adapt to each user's learning curve.
	- ### Remote Teleconferencing:
		- In situations where face-to-face communication is not feasible, CVEs can enable remote teams to work together on shared visual tasks like planning events, brainstorming ideas, or reviewing documents. Natural language AI can transcribe and analyse spoken conversations, providing real-time translations or summaries, while visual generative ML can create visual aids or dynamically update shared documents.
	- ### Virtual Art & Media Collaboration:
		- Artists, animators, and multimedia professionals can collaborate in CVEs to create and develop their projects, such as films, animations, or video games. Natural language AI can help in storyboarding, scriptwriting, or character development, while visual generative ML can generate new visuals or adapt existing assets based on user input and style preferences.
	- ### Data Visualization and Analysis:
		- Small teams working with large datasets can use CVEs to visually explore and analyze data in a more intuitive and engaging way. Natural language AI can help users query and interact with the data using conversational interfaces, while visual generative ML can generate new visualizations based on patterns and trends identified in the data.
	- ### Education and Virtual Classrooms:
		- Educators can leverage CVEs to create immersive learning experiences that engage students in collaborative activities, such as group projects, problem-solving, or scientific experiments. Natural language AI can facilitate communication, provide personalized tutoring, or assess student progress, while visual generative ML can create customized educational content based on individual needs and interests.
	- ### Virtual Labs and Scientific Research:
		- Researchers can use CVEs to conduct experiments, visualize complex data, or simulate real-world conditions in a controlled environment. Natural language AI can assist in interpreting results, automating lab protocols, or identifying research gaps, while visual generative ML can generate predictions or models based on existing data to support hypothesis testing and decision-making.
	- ### Biomedical:
		- In fields like chemical and medical molecular modeling, the integration of AI and generative ML technologies can significantly improve collaboration and innovation. Teams can work together in immersive environments to visualize complex molecular structures, benefiting from real-time AI-generated visuals and natural language processing.
	- ### Case Study: Biodiversity Monitoring and Data Exchange with Isolated Communities:
		- The case study presents an open-source collaboration infrastructure that leverages advanced technologies such as multi-modal large language models (LLMs), satellite communication, and cryptocurrency networks to facilitate sustainable and reliable biodiversity monitoring and data exchange in isolated communities. Key components include:
			- Language Model and Voice Interface
			- Data Collection and Storage
			- Live Connection and Model Tuning
			- Ecosystem Interventions

The open-source system must be developed in compliance with legislative and cultural norms while maintaining the balance between user privacy and the need for identity verification and data management. The evidence that social media is damaging youth mental health is very compelling. The Centre for Humane Technology calls social media the 'first contact point' with AI, explaining that new technologies often create an arms race. The underlying arms race for attention led to what they call 'an engagement monster' that rewrote the rules of society. These lessons should be learnt and the problems should be proactively mitigated. This proposal is not a social metaverse, and deliberately limits both numbers of participants and avatar optionality.
	- ### Managing Scalability, Performance, and Latency:
		- As the Metaverse continues to grow, it is crucial to ensure that the open-source system can scale effectively and maintain optimal performance. By using distributed and federated networks, the system can better manage latency and performance issues, ensuring a seamless user experience.
	- ### Promoting Open Standards and Interoperability:
		- For the Metaverse to truly thrive, it is essential to promote open standards and interoperability among various platforms and systems. This can be achieved by fostering collaboration between industry stakeholders, encouraging the development of open protocols, APIs, and data standards, and actively supporting the open-source community.
- ## Future Outlook and Potential Developments
	- ### AI and Generative ML Technologies:
		- As AI and generative ML technologies continue to evolve, their integration into the Metaverse will further enhance user experiences and create new opportunities for innovation. The release of models like GPT-4 have already prompted debate about general AI. It seems unavoidable that this will all impact on the Metaverse and digital society.

- # Additional Topics and Case Studies
- ### In-Camera VFX & Telepresence:
	- The proposed framework can be applied to film production and virtual production workflows. By leveraging the world's most powerful decentralized computing network (Bitcoin) and cryptographically assured endpoints, the system can enable scale and security without high cost. New tooling in the space allows for microtransactions and micropayments, radically improving creative microtask workflows. The unified digital backend is optimized for flows of money, trust, and digital objects, offering a new area for virtual production.
- ### Novel VP Render Pipeline:
	- Putting the ML image generation on the end of a real-time tracked camera render pipeline might remove the need for detail in set building. The set designer, DP, director, etc., will be able to ideate in a headset-based metaverse of the set design, dropping very basic elements. If the interframe consistency (img2img) can deliver, the output on the VP screen can simply inherit the artistic style from the text prompts and render production quality from the basic building blocks. This "next level pre-vis" is being trailed in the Vircadia collaborative environment described in this book.
- ### Money in Metaverses:
	- The proposed framework aims to connect creatives with very different global perspectives directly into 'Western' production pipelines. This can potentially heal the deep wounds caused by the slowing and 'cancellation' of creative progress in developed societies, as described by Fisher in "Ghosts of my life".
- ### ML Actors and Blockchain-based Bots:
	- Stability AI is an open-source initiative to bring ML/AI capabilities to the world. This is a hugely exciting emergent area, and much more will be developed here. There is work in the community on economically empowered bots that leverage Nostr and RGB to perform functions within the proposed metaverse and outside in the WWW, as well as interacting economically through trusted cryptography with other bots and human participants. This is incredibly powerful and is assured by the Bitcoin security model.
- ### AI Economic Actors in Mixed Reality:
	- AI actors can now be trusted visually. The proposed framework links the external web to the metaverse, allowing AI agents to interact with users in the metaverse and perform real-world tasks, such as purchasing flowers and delivering them to a physical address. These possibilities are endless, and the secure movement of money from the local context in the metaverse to the real world is within reach using these bots, which are completely autonomous and distributed.
- ### Our Socialization Best Practices:
	- #### Identity:
		- The framework bases identity and object management on Nostr public/private key pairs. The public key of these enables lightning-based exchange of value globally. Nostr will operate in multiple modes, with bot-to-bot communication within the private relay mesh and human-to-human text chat using private Nostr tags. External connectivity to web and Nostr apps is achieved through public relay tags outbound.
	- #### Webs of Trust:
		- Webs of trust will be built within worlds using economically costly (but private) social rating systems between any actor, human or AI. Poorly behaving AIs will eventually be excluded through lack of funds.
	- #### Integration of 'Good' Actor AI Entities:
		- Gratitude practice should be encouraged between AI actors to foster trust and wellbeing in human observers. "It's nice to be nice" should be incentivized between all parties, including tipping and trust nudging through the social rating system. Great AI behavior would result in economically powerful entities.
	- #### Emulation of Important Social Cues:
		- The framework considers classroom layout and other important social cues to create an effective learning and collaboration environment.
	- #### Behaviour Incentives, Arbitration, and Penalties:
		- Collapses of trust and abuse will trigger flags from ML-based oversight, creating situational records and payloads of involved parties to unlock with their Nostr private keys. ML red-flagged actors will be financially penalized but have access to human arbitration using their copy of the data blob. Nothing will be stored except by the end-users.
	- #### Federations of Webs of Trust and Economics:
		- Nostr is developing fast enough to provide global bridges between metaverse instances.
-
- The proposed open-source Metaverse framework leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Bitcoin, Lightning Network, Nostr, AI, and generative ML to create a secure, accessible, and inclusive digital society. By addressing challenges related to trust, accessibility, governance, and safeguarding, the framework aims to unlock new opportunities and use cases across various industries.
- The modular design of the framework allows for continuous evolution and adaptation, ensuring its relevance in the rapidly changing digital landscape. By fostering collaboration, promoting open standards, and engaging in industry conversations, the open-source Metaverse has the potential to transform how people live, work, and interact in the digital world.
- As the framework is implemented and refined, it is essential to prioritize security, privacy, scalability, and community building. Regular security audits, transparent privacy settings, and a focus on user engagement will help create a thriving ecosystem that benefits all participants.
- Looking ahead, the integration of advanced AI and generative ML technologies, coupled with the increasing adoption of spatial and augmented reality, will further enhance the capabilities and immersive nature of the open-source Metaverse. As AI actors become more sophisticated and economically empowered, they will play a crucial role in shaping the digital society and mediating governance issues.
- Ultimately, the success of the open-source Metaverse will depend on the collective efforts of developers, researchers, artists, and users working together to realize its transformative potential. By embracing the vision of an open, inclusive, and innovative digital society, we can create a Metaverse that empowers individuals, fosters creativity, and drives positive change on a global scale.
