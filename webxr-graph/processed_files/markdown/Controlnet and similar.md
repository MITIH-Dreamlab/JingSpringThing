              The ControlNet project provides a way to control diffusion models. It includes a number of features to help with this, including the ability to automatically download annotators and the ability to shift the guess mode to UC disconnect in order to save memory.

          This code snippet sets up Reddit's Sentry error monitoring, which includes a function to check for various types of errors and report them accordingly. Additionally, it sets up a fetch() wrapper to add a header specifying that Sentry should always be used in "sticky canary" mode.
      Multi scene videos using automatic1111

          1 go to Automatic1111 Deforum in interpolation mode and generate several pics regarding the prompt theme. Deforum interpolation is not good for animation, but it is good for generating lot of pics about the same subject.
          2 select the better images and put them in Deforum Init section. Then generate the animations in 2D or 3D. For this test I used only 10 steps, so graphics are not stellar. Repeat until you have several animations, each one on its directory.
          3 select the good animations. Pick the frames and put them in a directory. Then go to Deforum Output and select Pictures interpolation , put the frames here and interpolate with value 2. With this you generate the video.
          Note: I interpolated 693 frames. Tried bigger quantities and the interpolator did not work. So this method is pretty limited.

      ControlNet v1.1: A complete guide
	 - Stable Diffusion Art
       <https://stable-diffusion-art.com/controlnet/>
      The Twitter conversation includes an AI-generated video created by TomLikesRobots using canny edge detection and EbSynth technology to make a hobbit and Dumbledore contending with Sauron's will. Many people were impressed with the video and asked questions about the software and hardware used to create it. Finally, TomLikesRobots answered the questions by telling them he was using Windows 11, an RTX 3080 with 10GB VRAM and that the img2img part with ControlNet can be run online, but EbSynth might be trickier. https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1627073211656732676
      The text is a collection of video tutorials by Albert Bozesan, demonstrating how to use AI to create various types of digital art and design, including movie and game titles, vector graphics, pixel art, 3D assets, fantasy maps, motion graphics assets, and seamless textures. Bozesan uses a software called Stable Diffusion, which is free and runs on NVIDIA GPUs. He also mentions other AI tools such as ControlNet and Dream Textures for specific tasks. The videos show step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the software, as well as practical tips and techniques for achieving different visual effects. In addition, there are videos covering the latest AI research by NVIDIA and Google, as well as challenges with other artists using AI. The text also includes a note about the use of cookies and data on YouTube, as well as options for managing privacy settings. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sNcEhR65pw0&feature=youtu.be

      This is a conversation between TomLikesRobots about an experiment with "Ebsynth and Controlnet Img2img". TomLikesRobots has tried different noise percentage values and blends. The experiment involves switching out Elizabeth Moss for Penelope Cruz, and despite some difficulties, the team is making progress towards high-detail photorealism. https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1628104009146826763?s=20
      The paper proposes a novel approach to generate new video content by combining zero-shot text-to-video generation with ControlNet. The method takes multiple sketched frames as input and generates video output that matches the flow of these frames. By incorporating ControlNet to enable additional input conditions, the approach leverages the benefits of both zero-shot text-to-video generation and the robust control provided by ControlNet. Experiments demonstrate that the method excels at producing high-quality and remarkably consistent video content that accurately aligns with the userâ€™s intended motion for the subject within the video. A demo of the approach is also available for users to try out. https://sketchingthefuture.github.io/
