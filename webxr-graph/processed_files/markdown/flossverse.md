- ### Summary
	- With all this attention it seems timely to explore the potential ofrecent technologies, which can address collaborative mixed realityinteractions in itbusiness to business (B2B), itbusiness to customer(B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; itcreator to consumer,customer to customer, consumer to consumer [[jones2008trust]].

	- This book seeks to overview and explain the available open sourcetechnologies. It supports an open source [githubrepository](https://github.com/flossverse/product) which enables SMEs toaccess these emergent platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build towarda minimum viable product for trust minimised transfer of value within asocial immersive space, but also across all internet connected devices.
	- Referencing is in two styles; academic works and books are numeric,while opinion pieces, gray statistics, and pertinent news articles arehyperlinked from the text. This hybrid style yields about twice thecitation density of a normal PhD thesis, which is a lot. For this reasonthe normal blue hyperlink colour was eschewed in favour of a moreaesthetic “gray”.
- ## Rationalle
	- As human beings, we have always relied on certain social constructs toguide our interactions and transactions with one another. Money andtrust are two such constructs that have played a vital role in shapingour societies, and the way we live our lives. However, the digital agehas brought with it new challenges that are testing the foundations ofthese social norms.
	- In a world where we are increasingly connected through the internet andable to communicate with people from all corners of the globe, theconcept of money and trust is changing. Gone are the days of the villagestructure in which we evolved, where personal relationships andface-to-face interactions were ubiquitous. Now, we are faced with theprospect of working and interacting one another, and also withartificial intelligence actors that seem subjectively real, all whilenavigating the complexities of a global mixed reality.
	- This transition to a more efficient and interconnected world has thepotential to bring about great benefits, but it also presents us with anenormous challenge. The chaotic and intangible mix of value, trust,socialisation, generative art, and AI chat actors, is not yet wellunderstood, and it will take time for us to adapt to this new way ofliving and interacting with one another.
	- We initially wanted to explore exciting new developments in thetransmission of value, and trust, in ‘digital society’. The problem isthat each of these topics alone are enormously complex, and theintersections seem to be more so. We have been researching the currentstate-of-the-art, and the emerging consensus narrative, to try to figureout how the collision of these technologies might serve our virtualproduction workflows (Figure<a href="#fig:vprobot" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:vprobot">7.7</a>).As we worked on this research the Cambrian explosion of generative AIadded an incredibly important new strand to our investigation.
	- Over the course of a couple of years the focus of the work hasdeveloped, and refined. Our tool-kit, as it stands, supports inclusivehuman creativity and economic exchange, especially for emerging marketsand especially perhaps [Africa](https://www.afrobitcoin.org/). There isa huge proportion of human creativity currently excluded from mediaproduction pipelines due to gatekeepers of knowledge, access to identityproofs, and financial infrastructure that is taken for granted in thericher nations. This inclusion will be accomplished for the most partthrough integration of open source machine learning and AI tools, butthis field quite new, and that part of the work is under developed.
