- ## Drug Discovery and Molecular Biology
	- AI architectures, particularly those inspired by natural language processing (NLP) models, are demonstrating remarkable potential in handling vast datasets and intricate interactions within biological systems. These AI models are poised to accelerate scientific discovery by tackling challenges that traditional methods have struggled to address effectively.
	- Biological systems are characterized by intricate interplay of DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules within cells and organisms. Deciphering the complex interactions between these components is a grand challenge in biomedical science. Traditional analytical methods are not well-suited to the complexity of biological systems, leaving much more unknown than known about how cells, tissues, and bodies function at higher levels.
	- Modern AI architectures are very well suited to take advantage of biology's massive datasets, and a new wave of AI models are dramatically accelerating the process of scientific discovery in biology. These models are starting with understanding protein and other cellular structures and the physical interactions between them, and will likely soon zoom out to help understand how cells, tissues, and bodies function at higher levels.
	- ### Models and specifics
		- It is important to keep in mind the distinction between static structural analysis and dynamic conformational analysis, which allows for molecules to change shape as they interact with one another.
		- Foundation models for biology, along the lines of the large language models (LLMs) that many are familiar with, are just now starting to be trained. Different models are often used for predicting shapes versus predicting sequences, which are two sides of the same coin but are currently modelled separately.
		- AlphaFold 2, developed by DeepMind, marked a significant breakthrough in protein structure prediction. This AI model can predict a static 3D structure from a protein sequence, providing confidence scores for the predicted structure. However, AlphaFold 2 has limitations in capturing protein dynamics, highlighting the need for models that can predict multiple conformations and their transitions.
		- Distributional Graph Former, building upon AlphaFold 2's architecture, predicts ensembles of protein structures and transition pathways. AlphaFlow, a diffusion model trained on molecular dynamics simulation data, generates multiple protein conformations. These advancements demonstrate the potential of AI in capturing the dynamic nature of proteins.
	- ### Protein Language Models
		- Protein language models, built on architectures like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have emerged as powerful tools for predicting protein structures. ESM-Fold, for example, uses a masked language modelling objective to learn complex patterns and relationships within protein sequences, leading to accurate structural predictions without relying on physics-based simulations.
		- These models leverage multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to provide evolutionary information that aids in structure prediction. Attention maps in protein language models correlate with contact maps, representing physical contacts between amino acids, further emphasizing the model's ability to learn inherent structural information.
		- Training models to predict binding affinity and protein interactions is a challenging task. Overfitting is a common issue, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new data. Proper data splitting based on sequence and structural similarity is crucial to ensure the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This is particularly challenging for protein interaction models, where similar sequences might be present in both training and testing sets, leading to overfitting and poor generalization.
		- ### Protein Complexes
			- RoseTTAFold All Atom extends the capabilities of AlphaFold Multimer to predict the structure of complexes containing proteins with small molecules, nucleic acids, and metals. This represents a significant step forward in modelling interactions beyond protein-protein interactions.
		- ### Generative Models for Molecule Design
			- Generative models based on diffusion and flow-matching approaches enable fine-grained control over the generation of molecules with specific properties. ProteinDT and MoleculeSTM are examples of text-conditioned generative models that allow users to provide natural language prompts to generate molecules with desired properties.
			- RF Diffusion, a diffusion model built on the RoseTTAFold backbone, offers powerful functionalities for protein engineering. It enables unconditional generation of novel proteins, binder design for high affinity and specificity, partial diffusion for refining existing structures, motif scaffolding for combining functional motifs, symmetric generation of protein complexes, and fold conditioning for generating proteins with specific tertiary structures.
			- Complementary models like Ligand and PNN (Protein MPNN) are essential for designing amino acid sequences that fold into the desired 3D structures generated by RF Diffusion.
	- ## Practical Applications and Workflows
		- These advanced AI models can be integrated into practical workflows for drug discovery and protein engineering. For example, to design a protein inhibitor, the workflow may involve identifying a problematic protein-protein interaction, extracting the interaction motif using RF Diffusion, scaffolding a new protein structure incorporating the motif, optimizing the structure using Partial Diffusion and Ligand and PNN, and validating the interaction using AlphaFold Multimer.
		- The speed and efficiency of these models allow for rapid iteration and generation of many potential candidates with high accuracy and effectiveness. Hundreds or thousands of backbones can be designed, and hundreds or thousands of sequences can be designed for each backbone using Ligand and PNN in a matter of minutes. When synthesized and tested, these designed proteins often demonstrate high thermal stability, specificity, and binding affinity.
	- ## Bottlenecks in Drug Discovery
		- Despite the remarkable advancements, there are challenges and bottlenecks in the adoption of AI models in biological research. Target identification remains a significant challenge in drug discovery. The rapid evolution of the field and technical barriers, such as the requirement for programming skills and familiarity with computational environments, can hinder the widespread adoption of these models by researchers without a programming background. This is potentially an opportunity.
- # Agents in Biological Research
	- AI agents have the potential to transform biological research by automating tasks such as literature review, hypothesis generation, experimental design, and data analysis. Companies like Future House are developing AI agents that can identify potential drug targets and design experiments, significantly accelerating the process of discovery. These agents, powered by large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies, can review thousands of research papers, develop targets or hypotheses to test, and even drive autonomous labs.
	- As these AI agents become more capable, they may play a crucial role in guiding research and helping humans navigate the complex landscape of biological data and interactions. The convergence of AI agents with specific tools for designing molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids could lead to rapid progress in solving challenging problems in biology and medicine.
	- The development and application of AI-driven biology raise important ethical considerations and concerns related to potential misuse and the need for responsible development. While the computational design of toxic molecules is just one step in a complicated process that requires synthesis and delivery, the increasing capabilities of AI agents and the potential for state-sponsored bad actors highlight the need for oversight and safety measures.
	- Robust safety protocols, regulations, and ethical frameworks are essential to guide the development and application of these technologies. International collaboration is crucial to address the global nature of biological threats and prevent the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Hiring capable individuals with strong moral grounding and good intentions in companies and organizations working on these technologies is also important.
