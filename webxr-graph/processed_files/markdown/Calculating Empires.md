- The centerpiece of the exhibition is the [Calculating Empires Map Room](https://knowingmachines.org/publications/calculating-empires), which features two massive 12-meter long maps.
- One map focuses on communication and computation, covering the evolution of communication devices, interfaces, data practices, and computational architectures.
- The other map explores control and classification, examining how technologies have been integrated into social systems of [[Digital Society Surveillance]] , [[Education and AI]] , colonialism, [[Cyber Security and Military]]
- It starts in the 1500s, examining pivotal developments like the Gutenberg printing press and new maritime trade routes that expanded European [[Politics, Law, Privacy]]
- It takes a long-term view to reveal recurring patterns in how technology and power structures have developed over centuries.
- The visual style is inspired by sources like [Aby Warburg's "Atlas" project](https://warburg.library.cornell.edu/about/), using evocative imagery to trace historical evolutions.
- It aims to provide critical perspective on current AI developments by placing them in a broader historical context of technological power.
- The exhibition also includes a recreation of the creators' earlier work "[Anatomy of an AI System"](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/401279).
