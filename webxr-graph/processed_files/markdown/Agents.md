	- ## What are Agents
		- In the context of AI / LLM agents are programs or systems that are designed to simulate and mimic human intelligence and behaviour, frequently in a minimally supervised, or unsupervised way. They are increasingly capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including understanding and generating language, making decisions, solving complex problems, and learning from data. They can theoretically make informed decisions or recommendations. They have the potential to revolutionise various industries, improving efficiency and productivity in numerous domains, code writing being the main one

- **Automating Repetitive Tasks**:
	- AI offers the potential to automate mundane digital chores. This can revolutionize job efficiency and free up human resources for more creative and complex tasks.
	- The development of multimodal models and reinforcement learning is paving the way for richer, more intuitive user experiences, expanding AI's role in everyday life.
- **Logical Reasoning and Decision-Making**:
	- AI models currently struggle with complex logical reasoning, which impacts their decision-making abilities in nuanced tasks. This limitation is a critical area for future advancements.
- **Adaptation to New Environments and Online Learning**:
	- AI agents need substantial improvements in adapting to new environments and in their capability for online learning. This is crucial for their effective deployment in various real-world scenarios.
- **Navigating Complex Web Interfaces**:
	- Both humans and AI agents find it challenging to navigate and interpret complex web interfaces. This underscores the need for AI systems to improve their adaptation and learning mechanisms.
- **Data Privacy and Ethical Use**:
	- The use of personal data in AI training raises significant ethical concerns. There is a pressing need for stringent measures to responsibly handle personal identifiable information and ensure user privacy.
- **Cost and Efficiency Balancing**:
	- A major challenge lies in running sophisticated AI models economically while maintaining high efficiency. This concern becomes increasingly significant as the technology scales.

- ## OpenAI's Vision
	- Envisions ChatGPT as a super-smart personal assistant
	- Continuous development towards agent-like capabilities
	- Developing agents for device-specific and web-based tasks
	- Device agents automate actions like data transfer and report filling
	- Web agents handle internet-based tasks, expanding AI's utility
	- OpenAI's efforts could challenge [[Microsoft CoPilot]] which is somewhat explicitly designed for this role
	- Collaboration with developers through APIs to create agent experiences
- # User Trust and Acceptance
	- Overcoming perceptions associated with software that controls devices
- # Industry and Societal Implications
	- Potential to change work paradigms and interaction with technology
	- Raises ethical and privacy concerns regarding AI's role in decision-making
