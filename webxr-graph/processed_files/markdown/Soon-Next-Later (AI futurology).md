		- The beginning of AI [[Agents]]
			- intentional UX.
			- Having your personal agent, or it's agents, do the online work for you,
			- Bringing back distilled updates to a locally or securely hosted core agent.
			- This will have staggering repercussions for the web as we know it.
			- This is the old [[Death of the Internet]] conspiracy theory, but happening.
		- Semantic and natural language programming
			- In a future where intentional programming user experience (UX) evolves to its next stage, we could envision a scenario where multimodal and language models interface directly with bytecode, driven by semantic instructions from product owners. This approach would represent a significant leap from current programming paradigms, emphasizing a more intuitive, less syntax-heavy interaction with software development.
			- **1. Semantic Instruction and Bytecode Manipulation:**
				- In this future, product owners or non-technical stakeholders could provide instructions in natural language or through other intuitive interfaces.
				- These instructions would be semantically analyzed by advanced language models, capable of understanding the intent and context of the request.
				- The language models would then translate these semantic instructions into bytecode â the lowest-level code executed by the computer's processor.
				- This process bypasses traditional programming languages, allowing for more direct and efficient creation or modification of software functionalities.
			- **2. Multimodal Interfaces:**
				- Multimodal interfaces, incorporating voice, text, and possibly visual or gestural inputs, would make the process more accessible and intuitive.
				- These interfaces would cater to a diverse range of users and preferences, allowing instructions to be given in various formats.
			- **3. Enhanced Collaboration and Iteration:**
				- By enabling product owners to directly communicate their requirements to the software, the gap between idea conception and implementation narrows significantly.
				- This direct communication loop would facilitate rapid iterations, as changes can be implemented and reviewed in real-time or near-real-time.
			- **4. Automated Testing and Validation:**
				- The system would incorporate sophisticated automated testing mechanisms.
				- As soon as the bytecode is generated or modified, a series of automated tests could run to validate the functionality, ensuring that the changes meet the specified requirements and do not introduce bugs or vulnerabilities.
				- Product owners could also perform their own tests on the resultant functionality, using user-friendly testing tools integrated into this system.
