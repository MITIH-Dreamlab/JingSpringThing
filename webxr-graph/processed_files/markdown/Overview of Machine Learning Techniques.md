	- ## AI or ML or what?
	- It's not intelligent. It's just machine learning which is statistics.
	- Artificial intelligence is a marketing term, but it's supported in literature as the high level term.
	- [That's OK!](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/7/call-it-ai/)
	- I'm mainly going to use AI from here in.
