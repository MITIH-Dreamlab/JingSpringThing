- # The Golden Key: AI-Guided Emergent Narratives for Hyper-Personalized Location-Based Events
- ## Overview
- [The Golden Key](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196919) is an immersive, interactive art installation that generates never-ending, location-specific fairy tales using AI technologies. It combines large language models, generative AI, and user input to create unique, personalized narratives that evolve over time.
- ## Key Features
	- Three large projection screens display AI-generated visuals that illustrate the unfolding story
	- Kiosks allow participants to input their own story elements, which are integrated into the narrative within minutes
	- The AI system draws from a database of story motifs, archetypes, and folktales to create a cohesive, ever-evolving narrative
	- The installation adapts to each location, incorporating local history, artists, and cultural elements into the generated stories
- ## Technical Implementation
	- Backend infrastructure includes multiple high-performance computers running stable diffusion servers for image generation
	- ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 models are used for text generation, with the ability to request specific models for different parts of the system
	- Text-to-speech services are run locally to ensure reliability and reduce dependence on cloud services
	- TouchDesigner is used to create the three-panel projection mural, with slight parallax movement for a mesmerizing effect
- ## Artistic Vision
	- The Golden Key explores the concept of myth-making and the role of AI in shaping cultural narratives. It invites participants to consider the implications of living in a world where artificially generated stories are ubiquitous. The installation aims to encourage critical thinking about the impact of AI on creativity, diversity, and representation in media.
- ## Participant Experience
	- Participants approach kiosks where they are prompted to answer questions or provide story elements within a 60-second time limit
	- The user-generated content is then integrated into the ongoing narrative, appearing on the projection screens within minutes
	- Participants are encouraged to input multiple story elements and then sit back and watch how their contributions shape the unfolding tale
	- The AI-generated visuals and audio narration create an immersive, mesmerizing experience that adapts to each participant's input
- ## Future Developments
	- The creators of The Golden Key are exploring new possibilities for interactive, AI-driven experiences, including:
	- Incorporating video and 3D elements to enhance the liveliness and immersion of the generated content
	- Developing mobile app touchpoints that allow participants to interact with the installation beyond the physical space
	- Collaborating with other artists and researchers to address issues of bias, diversity, and representation in AI-generated media
	- Expanding the installation to include a wider range of cultural motifs, archetypes, and folktales from around the world
