	- **Instructions**: Look for specific logos or text indicating the exact model, usually found at the front or near the main controls. This will help verify the make and model.
- *I've found here on the top that it says xdj-xz. Tell me about this, thanks.*
	- **You're welcome!** The **Pioneer DJ XDJ-XZ** is a professional DJ controller integrating standalone hardware and software functionality, ideal for comprehensive DJ performances. It features a full-size jog wheel, multiple inputs/outputs, and advanced Pro DJ capabilities. Great choice!
