- # David Chaum and the history of eCash
	- The Chaumian mint refers to a concept in the field of cryptocurrency and digital privacy that is based on the principles outlined by David Chaum, a prominent cryptographer. This concept revolves around the idea of creating a secure and private form of digital currency that ensures the anonymity and confidentiality of transactions.
	- Famously it was almost integrated into early Microsoft Windows. [[Update Cycle]]
	- In essence, the Chaumian mint concept aims to provide a system where financial transactions can be conducted without revealing the identities of the parties involved, thus protecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' financial information. This is achieved through cryptographic techniques and protocols that allow for the secure exchange of digital currency without the need for a central authority to oversee or validate transactions.
	- By employing Chaumian mint principles, users can enjoy increased privacy and security when engaging in digital transactions, as their identities are kept confidential and their financial information is shielded from unwanted scrutiny. This concept aligns with the growing demand for privacy-focused technologies in the digital age, offering a potential solution for those who value anonymity and confidentiality in their financial interactions.
- ## Implentations
	- ### Ark
		- Ark is a payment system that provides anonymity to users and operates similarly to the classic Chaumian eCash system. However, unlike eCash, every transaction made through Ark is backed by actual bitcoins, preventing the possibility of the Ark Service Provider (ASP) stealing or inflating them. Compared to Lightning, another payment network, Ark does not introduce liquidity constraints or a direct link between the sender and receiver, enabling recipients to receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity or revealing their identity. In terms of UX, Ark mimics on-chain wallets by allowing async receiving and not introducing inbound liquidity constraints, but requires users to come online and "refresh" their coins every few weeks, or else the ASP can sweep the funds. Compared to validity rollups, Ark's higher throughput is due to not requiring on-chain data per transaction. If an ASP were to double-spend their pool transactions on mempool, incoming zero-conf vtxos can be used to pay lightning invoices, rendering double-spending a footgun for the service operator. A future extension of Ark can utilize a hypothetical data manipulation opcode to prevent double-spending. https://www.arkpill.me/faq

		- Fedimint (short for "Federated Mint") is a protocol that aims to provide a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for using Bitcoin in everyday transactions. It combines the concept of federated sidechains with the privacy features of confidential transactions.
	 - Federated Sidechains: Fedimint uses federated sidechains, which are separate blockchain networks that are anchored to the main Bitcoin blockchain. These sidechains allow for faster and cheaper transactions while still benefiting from the security of the Bitcoin network.
	 - Confidential Transactions: The protocol utilizes confidential transactions, which hide the amounts being transferred while still allowing the network to verify the validity of the transactions. This enhances privacy for users.
	 - Federated Mints: In Fedimint, "mints" are entities that issue tokens on the sidechain. These mints are federated, meaning they are operated by a group of independent parties who jointly control the issuance and redemption of tokens.
	 - Blind Signatures: Fedimint employs blind signatures, a cryptographic technique that allows users to request signatures on their transactions without revealing the content of the transaction to the signer. This further enhances privacy.
	 - Trustless Setup: The protocol is designed to minimize the trust required in the mints. Users can verify the solvency of the mints and withdraw their funds from the sidechain to the main Bitcoin blockchain at any time.
		- Benefits of Fedimint:
	 - Improved scalability and lower transaction costs compared to the main Bitcoin network.
	 - Enhanced privacy for users through confidential transactions and blind signatures.
	 - Increased accessibility for everyday Bitcoin transactions.
	 - Reduced trust requirements through the federated model and the ability to withdraw funds to the main chain.
		- Overall, Fedimint aims to provide a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that improves scalability, privacy, and usability while leveraging the security of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain.
