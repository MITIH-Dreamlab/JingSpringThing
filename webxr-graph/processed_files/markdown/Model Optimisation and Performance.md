- ## Quantization in Machine Learning Models
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1707150720702_0.png)
	-
	- ### Introduction
		- Quantization refers to the process of reducing the precision of the numbers that represent the weights and activations of a machine learning model without significantly reducing its accuracy.
		- It is a critical technique for deploying models on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones, embedded systems, and IoT devices.
		- [Quantization (huggingface.co)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/quantization)
	- ### Benefits of Quantization
		- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces the model size, enabling it to fit in the limited memory of small devices.
		- **Computational Efficiency**: Lower precision operations are faster and consume less power.
		- **Bandwidth Reduction**: Smaller models require less data to be transferred when downloaded or updated.
	- ### Strategies for Quantization
		- #### Sparsification
	 - **Description**: Involves reducing the number of non-zero elements in the model's weights, effectively compressing the model.
	 - **Techniques**:
				- Weight Pruning: Removing weights that have little impact on the output.
				- Structured Pruning: Removing entire channels or filters that are not contributing significantly to the model's performance.
	 - **References**:
				- [The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635)
		- #### Removal of Least Significant Bits (LSB)
	 - **Description**: This strategy involves truncating the least significant bits from the weights' binary representation.
	 - **Approach**:
				- Fixed-Point Quantization: Converts floating-point numbers to fixed-point format, removing the least significant bits.
				- Dynamic Quantization: Adjusts the quantization parameters dynamically based on the distribution of the parameters.
	 - **Benefits**:
				- Reduces the precision of weights with minimal impact on accuracy.
				- Simplifies the hardware implementation of mathematical operations.
	 - **References**:
				- [Post-Training Quantization](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization)
		- #### Uniform and Non-Uniform Quantization
	 - **Uniform Quantization**:
				- Applies the same quantization step size across all values.
				- Easier to implement but might not be optimal for all distributions of model parameters.
	 - **Non-Uniform Quantization**:
				- Adapts the quantization step size according to the distribution of the parameters.
				- Can achieve better accuracy for the same level of compression.

				- [Mixed Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740)
	- ### Tools and Frameworks for Quantization
		- **TensorFlow Lite**: Provides tools for post-training quantization and quantization-aware training.
	 - [TensorFlow Lite Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)
		- **PyTorch Quantization**: Supports dynamic quantization, static quantization, and quantization-aware training.
	 - [PyTorch Quantization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html)
		- **ONNX Runtime**: Offers support for quantized models, enabling optimized inference on different hardware.
	 - [ONNX Runtime Quantization](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/quantization.html)
	- ### Challenges and Considerations
		- **Accuracy Trade-offs**: Finding the right balance between model size reduction and accuracy preservation.
		- **Hardware Compatibility**: Ensuring quantized models are compatible with the target hardware's instruction set.
		- **Quantization Granularity**: Deciding between per-layer, per-channel, or per-tensor quantization for optimal performance.
	- **Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs)**
	- **Goal:** Reduce model size without sacrificing accuracy.
	- **Concept:** Lower precision representation of weights and activations (e.g., from 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers).
	- ### Key Techniques
	- #### [Overview of GGUF quantization methods : LocalLLaMA (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ba55rj/overview_of_gguf_quantization_methods/)
	- **Quantization:**
		- Rounding of weights and activations to lower precision representation.
		- **Example:**
		  
		  ```
		  Quantized Weight = Round(Original Weight / Scale)
		  ```
	- **Binary Quantization:**
		- Extremely aggressive quantization to binary values (1 or -1).
		- **Example:**
		  
		  ```
		  Binary Weight = Sign(Original Weight)
		  ```
	- **Ternary Quantization:**
		- Weights quantized to -1, 0, or 1.
		- Offers better information retention than binary quantization.
	- **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):**
		- Integrate quantization effects into the training process for smoother transitions and less accuracy loss.
		  
		  **Quantization Schemes**
	- **Fixed-Point:** Quantization into fixed bit-width representations.
	- **Logarithmic:** Leverages logarithmic scale for wider dynamic range.
	- **Quantized Inference**
	- Running inference using the quantized model.
	- Often requires integer math operations, leading to computational efficiency gains.
	- **Dequantization:** Process of converting quantized output back to a familiar floating-point representation.
	-
	- ### Benefits of QNNs
		- **Smaller model sizes:** Ideal for memory-constrained devices.
		- **Faster inference:** Lower precision often leads to faster computations.
		- **Reduced power consumption:** Benefits embedded systems and mobile devices.
		- Mobile and edge devices
		- Real-time applications
		- Resource-constrained environments

	- Hyperparameter optimization plays a crucial role in determining the performance of a machine learning model. They are one the 3 components of training.
	- 𝟛 ℂ𝕠𝕞𝕡𝕠𝕟𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕤 𝕠𝕗 𝕄𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕝:
	- 1️⃣ Training data: Training data is what the algorithm leverages (think: instructions to build a model) to identify patterns
	- 2️⃣ Parameters: Algorithm 'learns' by adjusting parameters, such as weights, based on training data to make accurate predictions, which are saved as part of the final model.
	- 3️⃣ Hyperparameters: Hyperparameters are variables that regulate the process of training and are constant during the training process.
	- 𝔻𝕚𝕗𝕗𝕖𝕣𝕖𝕟𝕥 𝕋𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕤 𝕠𝕗 𝕊𝕖𝕒𝕣𝕔𝕙:
	- 🔎Grid Search : Training models with every possible combination of the provided hyperparameter values a time-consuming process.
	- 🔎Random Search: Training models with randomly samples hyperparameter values from the defined distributions, a more effective search.
	- 🔎 Having Grid Search: Training models with all values, and then repeatedly "halving" the search space by only considering the parameter values that performed the best in the previous round.
	- 🔎 Bayesian Search: Starting with an initial guess of values, using performance of the model to the values. It's like how a detective might start with a list of suspects, then use new information to narrow down the list.
