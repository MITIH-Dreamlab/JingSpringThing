- I have been working on learning, and learning how to store that knowledge for myself and others since 2019 when I stopped being Technical Director of the [[Octave Multi Model Laboratory]] which followed on from the [[National Industrial Centre for Virtual Environments]].
- This website contains cross linked, well annotated, deeply cited knowledge across GenAI, Telepresence, Large Scale Display Systems, Distributed Systems, LLMs, Immersive Collaborative Spaces (metaverse), Politics, Law, Social Change, [[Convergence]], [[Disruption]] , and all the other things I have [studied for decades](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Etx-Au4AAAAJ&hl=en).
- It is increasing in size all the time. If you want upskilling on these things then I can give a physical or remote tour through the subset of knowledge that's right for -your- company or personal research needs. Afterwards, you will get a link to a page on my website which contains the knowledge graph suitable for you to extend and build upon the presentation.
- This graph is also the engine behind another new project we're starting; avatar based conversational agents backed by this knowledgebase, under [[Dreamlab]]
- # Suggested Order
	- I originally started this [as a book.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09460), so there **is** a natural reading order of sorts. I am still working on making this more of a "flow" so if it looks wrong just skip about. Some of these high level pages are dozens of pages each, and there are hundreds of such pages, with only a few highlighted here.
	- There's possibly around 1000 book equivalent pages overall.
