- # Product research programme
	- I'm working on an InnovateUK funded programme in a lab in MediaCity. We have money to spend on training people.
	- You have followed this link because you've been specifically invited to [this whatsapp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KwuFsntcsFdHYtPOjnt8EE), where we can light touch kick ideas about. You don't need to say anything in the group. You can come and go as you please. Just leave if it gets disinteresting or too much. It's MAINLY friends and family at this stage. You likely know everyone in the room a bit, but anyone can invite anyone they see fit so bear in mind it's a public forum to a degree.
	- I want to deliver pragmatic, useful tools for teachers, which save time on the organising and admin side of the job, freeing up more time for work life balance.
	- I have a LOT of tricks but I don't know how to apply them to your domains.
	- I am going to run a short an brisk seminar series. The sessions will be 45 minutes, likely starting at 4pm. Likely just 4 or 5 of them, on a weekly cadence. Probably Nov/Dec. Might be more early next year.
	- Nothing is yet decided, I want to find the most convenient fit for teachers at all levels.
	- I would initially like to investigate what the open problems are for educators, when engaging with AI, and when you're talking about it to students and colleagues, etc. I need to know what YOU think the problems are.
	- I want to do at least one group chat between us in Teams or zoom or Google or something, and as many 30 minute 1 to 1 sessions as people can give me to capture specific challenges. These are ALL optional, and we'll figure out how to do all that in the next few weeks.
	- Once the programme is developed you'd be welcome to join the formal sessions delivered from the lab. You can promote them in your institutions as something you have had a hand in building, and disseminate the online material as widely as you like.
	- If there's appetite we might push to physical sessions and there's a potentially a bit of (self reporting into your institution) clout to be had as the council and Uni's get more involved.
	- The material will eventually end up on these pages and website, which is mine. You can have a [look about](https://narrativegoldmine.com/#/page/introduction%20to%20me) if you like, but it's a distraction to be honest at this stage, everything is a bit too raw to be useful.

	- **AI as a Learning and Teaching Tool**:
		- AI, particularly GPT-4, is being effectively used as a tutor and learning aid for students and as a class preparation tool for teachers.
		- It offers adaptive, useful instruction, enhancing learning while reducing busywork.
	- **Challenges and Opportunities**:
		- The rise of AI raises concerns about cheating and its detection. This is, and will likely remain, undetectable.
		- However, it also opens doors for innovative teaching methods and aids in simplifying complex topics.
		- This is analogous to the calculator moment, we should step **in**, not away from this moment.
	- **AI in Classroom Settings**:
		- AI does not replace the multifaceted role of classroom teaching but complements it by providing support in understanding and applying concepts. It is the infinitely patient follow-up tutorial class. It is the reinforcement learning. It is the mock exams.
		- Classrooms provide additional value in terms of social interaction, skill application, and instructor support.
	- **AI and Assignment Types**:
		- AI's rapid adoption challenges traditional assignment types, necessitating a shift towards more interactive and AI-proof methods like oral exams and practical assessments. I don't think that's a bad thing so long as the AI can make time for this change by reducing the busywork.
	- **Instructor’s Role with AI**:
		- Educators **must** adapt to the ubiquitous use of AI in classrooms, using it as a tool for feedback, topic suggestions, and concept explanations. It will happen **to** them other
	- **Pedagogical Implications**:
		- AI offers personalized learning experiences and aids in the application of complex pedagogical approaches.
		- It allows for new forms of learning and pedagogy that can benefit both instructors and students.
	- **Future Directions**:
		- AI’s role in education is expected to grow, with increasing integration into teaching methodologies and curricula.
		- Educators should embrace AI technology and use it creatively in their teaching strategies.
	- **Adaptive Education System**:
		- The education system is poised to adapt effectively to AI, improving both learning experiences and teaching methodologies. This varies across nations, educational ages, and class boundaries.
	- **Balancing AI and Traditional Methods**:
		- While AI presents new challenges, it also offers significant opportunities for enhancing education, requiring a balanced approach to its integration. We need to be doing more.
