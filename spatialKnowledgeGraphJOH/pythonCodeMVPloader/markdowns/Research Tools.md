	- ## Elicit's Approach and Features
		- ### AI Research Assistant
		- Elicit is an AI research assistant that aims to make high quality reasoning abundant
		- Currently focused on text-based workflows, especially literature summarization and helping users understand what is known on a topic based on existing research
		- Long-term goal is to go further into reasoning and decision making
		- ### Systematic Review Automation
		- Elicit's workflow is inspired by the systematic review or meta-analysis process used to summarize scientific literature
		- Aims to automate this laborious process which typically involves teams of people working for over a year to find relevant papers, extract data, and summarize findings
		- Makes this capability more accessible for any research question
		- ### Key Features
		- Enter a research question and get back relevant papers along with AI-generated summaries of each paper with respect to the query
		- Extract structured data from papers into tabular format (e.g. population studied, methods used, interventions, outcomes)
		- Provide a description or instructions for data to extract, allowing custom extraction
		- Group or pivot extracted data by arguments, effects, interventions, techniques rather than just by paper
		- Notebook interface allows users to interactively search for papers, extract data, analyze results, and share templates of analysis with others
		- ### Approach to Building Elicit
		- Extensive testing of language model capabilities and designing human evaluation processes before powerful models were available
		- Breaking down complex reasoning tasks into granular steps that language models can be trained on and evaluated against
		- Intentionally not just training a model on a large dataset, but defining ideal step-by-step processes an expert would follow
		- Enables easier evaluation, troubleshooting and transparency into model's reasoning process
