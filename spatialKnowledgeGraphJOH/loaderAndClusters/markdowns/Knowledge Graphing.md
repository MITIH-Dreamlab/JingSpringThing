- ## Obsidian
	- **Obsidian**: A markdown-based note-taking app designed for knowledge management and building a personal knowledge base. Obsidian's key feature is its ability to create a network of interlinked notes, enabling users to visualize the connections between their thoughts and information.
- ## Others
	- **Roam Research**: This tool is known for its bi-directional linking and its graph overview, which shows how notes are interconnected. Roam is designed to facilitate associative thought, making it easy to see connections between ideas.
	- **Dynalist**: A list-making application that allows for infinite levels of nesting. While primarily a list-maker, it also offers features for linking between lists and items, thereby enabling some degree of knowledge graphing.
	- **TiddlyWiki**: A unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organizing, and sharing complex information. It allows for linking between different Tiddlers (small pieces of information) to create a web of notes.
	- **Zettelkasten Method Tools**: This method emphasizes creating a network of linked notes. Tools like Zettlr or The Archive are designed with the Zettelkasten philosophy in mind, offering features that facilitate linking between notes and creating a knowledge web.
	- **Microsoft OneNote**: A digital notebook that provides a flexible canvas for capturing notes in various formats. It allows for some degree of linking and organizing, suitable for knowledge management.
	- **Evernote**: Known for note-taking, it also provides features for organizing and linking notes, although it's more linear compared to tools like Obsidian or Logseq.
- ## Logseq
	- **Logseq**: is very similar to Obsidian, but self hosted and open source. It works on top of plain text files stored in a local system. It supports markdown and Org-mode formatting and allows for hierarchical and networked note-taking. It can be connected to it's mobile app via github.
	- Integration to [[Large language models]] can be OpenAI or local.
