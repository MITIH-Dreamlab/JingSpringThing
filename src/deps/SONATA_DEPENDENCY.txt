Sonata Dependency Information

The sonata repository has been successfully integrated into this project as a local dependency.

Location: src/deps/sonata

Integration:
- The sonata dependency has been added to the Cargo.toml file as a local dependency.
- You can now use sonata in your Rust code by adding `use sonata;` where needed.

Updating:
To update the sonata dependency in the future, you can either:
1. Pull the latest changes directly into the src/deps/sonata directory if it's a git repository.
2. Manually replace the contents of src/deps/sonata with the latest version of the sonata codebase.

After updating, you may need to run `cargo clean` and `cargo build` to ensure all changes are properly incorporated.

Note: Ensure that the version of sonata you're using is compatible with your project's requirements.
